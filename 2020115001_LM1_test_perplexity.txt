"And that," said Mrs	316.22776601683796
I do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr	3.1622776601683795
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr	17.78279410038923
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten	2.1017480113324885
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	3.3598182862837818
It is Mr	1.0
Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr	4.216965034285822
It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace	2.9935772947204895
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle	8.111308307896872
so tall	1.0
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley	1.2710617996147449
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to
understand it	2.346228848142263
6	1.0
Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_	2.51188643150958
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him	8.111308307896872
Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight	2.610157215682537
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever	2.346228848142263
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr	2.212216291070449
She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent	26.82695795279725
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance	2.4244620170823286
"La	1.0
It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way	4.216965034285822
She
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different	4.641588833612778
Darcy was fixed in astonishment	100.00000000000003
But I dare not
hope it	4.266137793993597
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley	17.78279410038923
Well, well, I only hope it
will last	17.78279410038923
Her answer was warmly in his favour	26.82695795279725
The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow	2.9935772947204895
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all	4.641588833612778
I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park	5.179474679231211
Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward	8.111308307896872
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry	1.5441135899948315
--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay	2.4244620170823286
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	2.9935772947204895
In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library	1.93069772888325
A clear ten
thousand per annum	46.41588833612778
Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where	10.000000000000002
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them	5.878016072274914
I don't know	1.0
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result	5.878016072274914
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority	2.212216291070449
He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it	1.8047217668271702
I have a high respect for your nerves	17.78279410038923
They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants	2.9935772947204895
CHAPTER VII	1.0
He takes them now for people of
fashion	17.78279410038923
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think	3.3598182862837818
To know
that her daughter would be married was enough	10.000000000000002
It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before	1.8632463119315603
"Is it possible	1.0
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters	3.593813663804627
Bingley's continued
absence	1.0
Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women	1.8632463119315603
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here	5.179474679231211
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	26.82695795279725
His debts are to be paid,
     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased	2.154434690031884
But, really, I know not what to say	17.78279410038923
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof	46.41588833612778
She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him	2.610157215682537
"Is it not clear enough	100.00000000000003
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning	17.78279410038923
Jenkinson were sitting	1.0
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome	3.593813663804627
Mrs	1.0
"How strange	1.0
"I should imagine not	316.22776601683796
My temper
would perhaps be called resentful	26.82695795279725
Darcy	1.0
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship	3.874675120456131
Mr	1.0
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day	4.216965034285822
Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man	2.1017480113324885
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married	2.0092330025650473
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks	5.878016072274914
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness	5.878016072274914
I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	3.593813663804627
E	1.0
Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	4.216965034285822
what could she mean by
it	46.41588833612778
But however he did not	100.00000000000003
"Mr	1.0
"And have you heard from him often	26.82695795279725
For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof	2.848035868435802
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand	5.878016072274914
Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them	12.915496650148837
--Do you think it incredible
that Mr	26.82695795279725
Mr	1.0
"This will not do," said Elizabeth	46.41588833612778
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious	12.915496650148837
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came	3.3598182862837818
exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good	46.41588833612778
--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you	6.812920690579612
With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted	10.000000000000002
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea	5.878016072274914
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_	4.641588833612778
Forster,
the delight of Mrs	100.00000000000003
He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her	2.4244620170823286
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr	6.812920690579612
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing	1.5848931924611136
This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married	6.812920690579612
"La	1.0
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
Mrs	2.9935772947204895
It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing	3.874675120456131
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel	2.7213387683753076
And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission	2.848035868435802
"John told us Mr	316.22776601683796
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe	1.3433993325989002
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure	316.22776601683796
Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented	4.216965034285822
"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this	4.216965034285822
I
thank you for explaining it so fully	17.78279410038923
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr	12.915496650148837
I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr	5.878016072274914
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter	3.1622776601683795
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance	1.599858719606058
Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me	10.000000000000002
But the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties	5.179474679231211
cried Mrs	1.0
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth	46.41588833612778
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance	2.346228848142263
Collins began	1.0
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	4.216965034285822
Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so	2.848035868435802
_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope	26.82695795279725
Mrs	1.0
Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you	17.78279410038923
The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	2.346228848142263
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit	2.212216291070449
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs	12.915496650148837
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr	2.51188643150958
"Mrs	1.0
I am most seriously displeased	100.00000000000003
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	12.915496650148837
He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks	2.154434690031884
She will follow wherever Lydia leads	46.41588833612778
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him	2.0535250264571463
I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	12.915496650148837
CHAPTER IX	1.0
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza	3.593813663804627
C below	1.0
to
put me on my guard	46.41588833612778
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him	3.593813663804627
Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it	2.848035868435802
Had the late Mr	316.22776601683796
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road	2.51188643150958
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away	3.593813663804627
Darcy speaking to her	316.22776601683796
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing	1.8632463119315603
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn	1.5570684047537309
she cried	1.0
Collins and Lizzy	1.0
I do not wish to avoid the walk	17.78279410038923
What are we to do	100.00000000000003
Could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life
     saw him so affected	2.212216291070449
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone	2.7213387683753076

In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	2.610157215682537
Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life	3.3598182862837818
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner	3.593813663804627
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head	3.3598182862837818
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it	2.212216291070449
We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness	12.915496650148837
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs	3.3598182862837818
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter	3.3598182862837818
"Your affectionate friend,

"It must not be thought of	46.41588833612778
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger	3.1622776601683795
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	2.9935772947204895
Bennet were dead	1.0
She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice	1.599858719606058
I have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare	2.346228848142263
I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding	6.812920690579612
"There
is nothing the matter with me	26.82695795279725
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it	5.179474679231211
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there	1.968419447286612

When
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	1.4773776525985112
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt	5.878016072274914
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield	2.7213387683753076

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him	2.1017480113324885
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears	3.593813663804627
I dare say I shall
soon see them here	12.915496650148837
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter	4.641588833612778
It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in	6.812920690579612
"And what am I to do on the occasion	12.915496650148837
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do	2.154434690031884
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere	5.878016072274914
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it	17.78279410038923
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it	26.82695795279725
"My dear, you flatter me	100.00000000000003
On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	2.346228848142263
I knew you would be wishing me joy	17.78279410038923
Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist

My resolution of

Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr	1.7534865500829584
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form	2.51188643150958
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her	3.874675120456131
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	12.915496650148837
Pray do not talk of that odious man	17.78279410038923
But to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming

Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so	3.1622776601683795
I cannot do justice to his kindness	26.82695795279725
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty	1.8632463119315603
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet	2.51188643150958
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance	2.610157215682537
And do you
really love him quite well enough	12.915496650148837

Bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's

"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things	2.7213387683753076
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr	2.7213387683753076
She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs	1.599858719606058

Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself	1.2451970847350329

     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being	2.154434690031884
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	1.6681005372000588

therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females	1.8329807108324359

Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma	3.1622776601683795
I rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal	2.9935772947204895

not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her	2.7213387683753076

It was a large, handsome, stone

swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance	1.8329807108324359

But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters	1.7082763938087104
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	1.93069772888325
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,

at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place	1.7082763938087104

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy	1.5706464294715548
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love

Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention	5.878016072274914

can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going

I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony	4.641588833612778
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make	1.41011239906908

look at Netherfield House	2.9935772947204895

dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its

to Elizabeth again, he walked away	2.610157215682537
"Yes, almost every day	316.22776601683796

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their

     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design	2.0535250264571463
The certainty of

might not unreasonably have alarmed her	2.9935772947204895

been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable	1.4977474763452012
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is

continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry	2.7213387683753076

scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family	1.8329807108324359

the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr	1.6876124757881479
"Oh	1.0
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side	1.4030037231905736

more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the

Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of

Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs	1.4873521072935114

seriously to work to find it out	1.4977474763452012

Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any

alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of

with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike

_

     DEAR SIR,

     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance	1.3485595530525598
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	2.0535250264571463

My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr	4.216965034285822
"Your's sincerely, &c	1.0
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend	8.111308307896872
You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself	4.216965034285822
--With respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr	6.812920690579612
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear	3.874675120456131
--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections	12.915496650148837
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative	2.212216291070449
Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you	3.874675120456131
His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart	1.7301957388458942
Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm	8.961987766046315
Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity	1.3287913432286882
Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word	17.78279410038923
She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet	3.1622776601683795
No one but Mrs	4.0843621302981985
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn-house	10.000000000000002
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr	5.878016072274914
Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day	1.8632463119315603
You must learn some
of my philosophy	26.82695795279725
You shall hear what she says	46.41588833612778
No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation	5.878016072274914
But of course she did not mention my name to you	8.111308307896872
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein	2.212216291070449
Thank Heaven	1.0
I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly	10.000000000000002

what they were talking of	3.874675120456131

gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,

Jane now came up	316.22776601683796
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning	1.3433993325989002
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence	2.212216291070449
my dear Mr	1.0
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and

a reply	4.216965034285822
The comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression	5.878016072274914
But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years	1.3830728955554412
Wickham began the subject himself	100.00000000000003
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world I love, and he is an angel	1.93069772888325

unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr	2.610157215682537

softened by his manner of expressing himself	2.9935772947204895

right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older	2.9935772947204895

They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse	1.5085907086001784
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs	10.000000000000002

the little value he put on his own good qualities	2.9935772947204895

And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North	2.2758459260747883
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr	8.111308307896872
"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character	1.8329807108324359
In a few minutes, Mrs	6.044088088056358

his coming	4.641588833612778
Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well	1.4677992676220695

"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination	1.3708385261355818

With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning	2.346228848142263
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life	2.2758459260747883
It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr	6.812920690579612
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	1.5199110829529336
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it	1.632172128563275
But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself	3.874675120456131
She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	1.6681005372000588
Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them	2.7213387683753076
You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it	4.216965034285822
"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley	5.878016072274914
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal	2.0535250264571463
And, above all things, keep Mr	46.41588833612778

This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr	3.593813663804627
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was	1.6876124757881479
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried	12.915496650148837
Only look at her	316.22776601683796
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr	3.874675120456131
The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr	2.9935772947204895

service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as

In the hall they parted	100.00000000000003
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas	2.0092330025650473

Fitzwilliam, what do I play next	17.78279410038923
--Oh, my
dear Lizzy	1.8816969230895328

aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon	2.7213387683753076
Bennet	1.0
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment	8.111308307896872
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable	8.111308307896872
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr	1.7782794100389228
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived	5.179474679231211
But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud	10.000000000000002
Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself	3.874675120456131
I am sorry to pain you--but so it was	12.915496650148837
said Elizabeth	1.0
I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so	5.878016072274914
Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return	1.5706464294715548
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	5.179474679231211
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave	2.610157215682537
Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time	1.7301957388458942
See paragraph 1	1.0
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_	3.3598182862837818
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me	10.000000000000002

Mr	5.878016072274914

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago	2.1017480113324885

Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall

Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home	2.154434690031884
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
sisters	2.0535250264571463
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself	2.7213387683753076
If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss De Bourgh	2.0092330025650473
And is it really true	100.00000000000003
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	2.7213387683753076
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery	4.216965034285822
They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long	2.610157215682537
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	2.848035868435802
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds	2.1017480113324885

much as possible against Mr	3.874675120456131
From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents	5.878016072274914
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	1.8957356524063758
In 2001, the Project

Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light	2.4244620170823286
--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been	2.7213387683753076
"My dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight	12.915496650148837

circumspection	5.878016072274914
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr	2.9935772947204895
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters	2.346228848142263

--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement	2.7213387683753076
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance	1.4585940117250362
Their manners are not equal to his	26.82695795279725

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in

Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr	2.848035868435802
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate	1.7534865500829584

But it is all, all too late now	17.78279410038923
I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not	3.3598182862837818
Mrs	1.0
There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again	3.1622776601683795
Darcy may hug himself	316.22776601683796
I see the imprudence
of it	46.41588833612778
He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before	2.7213387683753076
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes	3.1622776601683795
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained	1.599858719606058
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	8.111308307896872
"Excuse my interference	1.0
Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain	3.1622776601683795
He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger	3.3598182862837818
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied	8.111308307896872
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs	1.6876124757881479
With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart	2.7213387683753076
"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty	3.874675120456131
We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect	4.641588833612778
Mr	1.0
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter	1.7534865500829584
Every thing
that is charming	100.00000000000003
"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful	10.000000000000002
--Your uncle	1.0

was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many	2.346228848142263

Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it	4.216965034285822
Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way	2.7213387683753076
All was joy and
kindness	100.00000000000003
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret	5.179474679231211
But it is of small importance	46.41588833612778
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard	3.1622776601683795
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn	2.212216291070449
_Invented by M^{rs} Bell 26 Charlotte Street Bedford Square	12.915496650148837
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit	2.1017480113324885
Darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	4.641588833612778
Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away	2.346228848142263
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded	4.641588833612778

ready to think your own children silly	5.878016072274914

Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr	1.7082763938087104
"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you	10.000000000000002
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr	8.111308307896872
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied	26.82695795279725
Mr	1.0
cried his wife impatiently	16.819643236724303
To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit	4.641588833612778
Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr	2.212216291070449
Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land	1.6876124757881479
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her	4.216965034285822
And with no one to speak to, of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had	1.93069772888325
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	1.8632463119315603
I
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes	6.812920690579612
"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly	1.7301957388458942
Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable	5.878016072274914
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room	1.7082763938087104
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character	4.216965034285822
Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us	3.593813663804627
Then addressing her daughter, "Oh	100.00000000000003
The next was in these words	46.41588833612778
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_	2.610157215682537
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say	17.78279410038923

condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs	6.812920690579612
He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr	1.53174046370208
Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it	4.216965034285822
She could think only of her letter	26.82695795279725
"Is my father in town	100.00000000000003
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away	1.8632463119315603
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners	4.641588833612778
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him	46.41588833612778
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain	10.000000000000002
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	3.3598182862837818
Those who do not complain are never
pitied	17.78279410038923
"How can you contrive to write so even	17.78279410038923
But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company	1.968419447286612
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter	2.4244620170823286
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room	5.179474679231211
"And so was I	316.22776601683796
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief	4.216965034285822
A house in town	1.3729110796406907
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	2.51188643150958
--Mr	1.0
She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged	2.2758459260747883
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world	5.179474679231211
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs	26.82695795279725
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand	2.4244620170823286
"We never had any governess	100.00000000000003
Bennet was quite
disconcerted	15.787638844586777
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out	2.610157215682537
They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	1.8047217668271702
I know you will contrive it all	26.82695795279725
The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles	6.812920690579612
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again	2.0092330025650473
"Can it be
possible that he will marry her	12.915496650148837
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to	1.8957356524063758
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself	1.8329807108324359
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one	8.111308307896872
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte	2.610157215682537
But who was your mother	100.00000000000003
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr	3.874675120456131
"How could
you begin	8.538336782086573
They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride	1.8957356524063758
E	1.0
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do	1.5085907086001784
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations	2.610157215682537
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself	10.000000000000002
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it	5.179474679231211
Why any fear of detection	100.00000000000003
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror	3.874675120456131
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr	5.878016072274914
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem	5.878016072274914
Mr	1.0
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look	1.5199110829529336
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared	12.915496650148837
It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance	3.593813663804627
Mr	1.0
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits	1.3830728955554412
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed	10.000000000000002
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive	2.51188643150958
I am not at all afraid of her dying	12.915496650148837
certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions	5.878016072274914
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter	1.5085907086001784
"If I were as rich as Mr	26.82695795279725
You know not what you are
about	26.82695795279725
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement	2.51188643150958
--"Oh	1.0
Then turning to Mr	316.22776601683796
"Oh, lord	1.0
"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy	3.874675120456131
she cried: "This is delightful indeed	46.41588833612778
He
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it	3.1622776601683795
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	2.7213387683753076
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise	2.848035868435802
Wickham's attentions	1.0
--You ought all to have learned	46.41588833612778
I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior	2.51188643150958
"I am," said he, with a firm voice	17.78279410038923
When she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous	17.78279410038923
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands	2.848035868435802
Perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event	2.848035868435802
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them	2.848035868435802
"A place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected	6.812920690579612
Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs	26.82695795279725
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head	2.2758459260747883
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected	6.812920690579612
In that case he would return no more	17.78279410038923
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr	2.4244620170823286
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	2.9935772947204895
Howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
     by Mrs	3.1622776601683795
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	2.1017480113324885
Mr	1.0
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire	1.3830728955554412
Professor Michael S	1.0
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley	5.179474679231211
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	1.615598098439874
But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend	1.4030037231905736
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful	1.5570684047537309
"I never heard any thing so
abominable	26.82695795279725
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related	2.212216291070449
Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone	1.5441135899948315
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia	1.0
As yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness	3.593813663804627
No one made any reply	100.00000000000003
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves	2.4244620170823286
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers	5.878016072274914
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others	2.0535250264571463
A few days after this visit, Mr	26.82695795279725
And pray what sort of guardians do you make	12.915496650148837
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr	17.78279410038923
And poor Mr	1.0
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence	1.8329807108324359
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs	316.22776601683796
said Elizabeth	1.0
Is this to be endured	10.599869069336007
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another	2.346228848142263
From that moment I
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then
     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
     ever witnessed in him	2.212216291070449
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business	1.8047217668271702
I will put on my things in a moment	12.915496650148837
"And pray
may I ask	100.00000000000003
I had not an idea of it	26.82695795279725
"I will make no promise of the kind	17.78279410038923
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case	10.000000000000002
Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	5.179474679231211
--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man	6.812920690579612
He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	4.641588833612778
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding	26.82695795279725
She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
