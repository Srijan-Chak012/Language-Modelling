     not yet learnt to condemn themBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther	115.59667441356021

pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow	86.65579530488814

the British court of its brightest ornament"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular	230.48656343046486
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcomeCharlotte's first letters	256.49503422200945
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be	83.91434273705492
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would	109.53562784551063
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to	52.96193810336364
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte	215.11129487734905
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseenThat he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest	81.26352111799241

in any other person presentThe ladies were somewhat more	393.5283320460429
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper	64.87986258531062
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horseShe tried, however, to compose herself to	107.68587724167847

chance of itHe was at the same time haughty, reserved, and	36.770931887973994
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be	76.98884614698127
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,	47.588617469085825
it would be an unpleasant thingBut in spite of all this	22.373614148045675

that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,	64.40143749345062
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was	41.479093229069704
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made	50.04476028525178
him think really ill of her--That they might have met without ill consequence, is	164.647621171326
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough	70.90188885216814

expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own	109.31360948971565

to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than	189.69799119006643

having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in	123.38947842306108
business in LondonIt was	18.355625301245812
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its	69.9151528331838
owner"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him	335.0721066609599

guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its	111.37029424194914
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and	66.96448463334978

believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand	61.386903027100686

be any other than highly desirableElizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from	124.90527897966656

favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost	67.78744489012922
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon"That is as it happensAll that is known after this is, that they were seen	90.0992414696305

it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,	86.72742206810578

point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being	93.42668507291579

felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,	78.93998566906689
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a	59.062457663555044

immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving	69.0676852094624
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed	123.46649105647685
for such a visit, was delighted at her entranceHow Mr--_You_	39.677728570683385

hours"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from	69.67631404073526
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfectionsHer younger	74.47046848836833

as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for	96.27791532164132
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had	97.89832280141913
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and	172.3208056211747
more foolish than his daughterElizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer	195.82502359592772
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a	83.51673120588846
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent	77.97493413115444
reason for what she did, for MrBut as it is--you	31.8821721824566

moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had	74.99235485033121
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had	69.15980378303932
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It	64.84669483008852

     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_	59.0729424204317
     reserve, can be answerable for the event"Not at allThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have	42.10806063756657
answered her hopes; but, alasWith amazement did	316.14937578288027
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;	89.69844981470662
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to	66.57570475721839
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal"Oh, yes"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his	81.71663192244881
countenanceShe	1.0
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,	86.48655945806915
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what	80.14520144832217
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been	121.35321636144437

somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,	91.2655899734286

them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference	65.96430417185363
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she	45.58280168225277
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left	47.92525529981954
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such	101.29806345673495
an attachment"Your friend performs delightfully;" he	81.73159463036238
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt	221.4052883903843

indignation"TrueCHAPTER XVIIIHere again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet	186.808330774564

uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the	51.139196208009665

of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what	147.47204010871263
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their	43.2485326224425
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,	61.899666272909165
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her	127.4278212210783
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,	96.10073522100173

painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of	99.76865011837305
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject	108.85687069286296

cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she	155.33745937311187
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss	44.490596241098885

all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when	56.53492163892719
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her	85.86676872362585
