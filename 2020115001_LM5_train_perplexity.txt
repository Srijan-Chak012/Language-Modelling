PRIDE & PREJUDICE	82.47086025590805
CHAPTER I	4.88293655229344
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife	86.36902182195526
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters	129.43330744312775
"My dear Mr	13.246607175751276
Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last	223.14751816144246
Mr	1.0
Bennet replied that he had not	18.221812593099475
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs	92.94422639959542
Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it	83.84853614930232
Mr	1.0
Bennet made no answer	20.273607004326703
"Do not you want to know who has taken it	59.133436552081186
cried his wife impatiently	147.3305488296284
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it	53.02790542222718
This was invitation enough	304.18373903240126
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs	52.906493563665016
Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr	105.54161173707026
Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week	99.8255945089167
"What is his name	28.62071575872436
"Bingley	1.0
"Is he married or single	163.81351192104313
"Oh	1.0
single, my dear, to be sure	24.475254374890465
A single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year	102.05064245941465
What a fine thing for our girls	121.37313208912946
"How so	8.33933905282705
how can it affect them	85.74460931876285
"My dear Mr	13.246607175751276
Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome	97.09532677728812
You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them	40.9631392640384
"Is that his design in settling here	130.94480986550585
"Design	1.0
nonsense, how can you talk so	104.5332936371694
But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes	88.06543858977336
"I see no occasion for that	59.87668552209145
You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr	183.79707381491207
Bingley might like you the best of the
party	87.92360924272153
"My dear, you flatter me	69.65177077917934
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now	70.70653374020246
When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty	316.0761924532349
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	116.74299619628546
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr	82.04720299071622
Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood	38.712480269215405
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you	45.16685201592309
"But consider your daughters	65.44999374403811
Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them	154.15697261829345
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers	171.08671350579368
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not	43.33353976022864
"You are over scrupulous surely	106.75171003482299
I dare say Mr	27.323402017074198
Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy	101.83778762721471
"I desire you will do no such thing	198.53659997008074
Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good humoured as Lydia	82.8820668505484
But you are always giving _her_ the
preference	70.43000270899314
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters	203.37384841492357
"Mr	1.0
Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way	133.3110889039408
You take
delight in vexing me	34.11214136649955
You have no compassion on my poor nerves	75.29463924060221
"You mistake me, my dear	66.72488522033649
I have a high respect for your nerves	66.04887653660357
They
are my old friends	90.91912034855063
I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least	207.42124885777167
"Ah	1.0
you do not know what I suffer	22.979164184513333
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	96.04712941641702
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them	127.3363353767817
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all	150.05938358376216
Mr	1.0
Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	131.1054713986615
_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope	33.440375085626336
She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper	564.9954878457016
When she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous	260.3092704904776
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news	124.13966520874928
CHAPTER II	30.593157938584177
Mr	1.0
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr	131.51348207760964
Bingley	1.0
He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it	115.01373669185165
It was then disclosed in the following
manner	39.692434891887586
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"I hope Mr	89.60354619652516
Bingley will like it Lizzy	78.27560616839497
"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr	27.90571130605595
Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit	158.1495679738324
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs	89.97969702292191
Long has promised to introduce him	97.70196747207955
"I do not believe Mrs	20.799833232432896
Long will do any such thing	193.22198141701946
She has two nieces
of her own	46.45267315181262
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her	58.680454958636055
"No more have I," said Mr	132.26159215889757
Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you	23.893671889652246
Mrs	1.0
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters	152.59174668590478
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake	145.25686957765328
Have a little
compassion on my nerves	180.6105000856364
You tear them to pieces	101.02019940857275
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill	201.9272293638636
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully	240.51564973675679
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy	89.17157640323137
"To-morrow fortnight	151.4821203223533
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs	58.10213758019743
Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself	68.49957737517657
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr	67.684905901657
Bingley to _her_	13.833691597082096
"Impossible, Mr	14.081490914019264
Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing	121.23094426138903
"I honour your circumspection	456.8307046963058
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little	122.1283805318644
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight	69.47108217632066
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs	654.0621258902339
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself	198.44828008283736
The girls stared at their father	202.2788119126864
Mrs	1.0
Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense	2800.8772161051934
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation	60.247735394874404
cried he	14.370897326612145
"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense	93.63898178675188
I cannot quite agree with you _there_	81.56956090943092
What say you,
Mary	136.02301217931077
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
books, and make extracts	193.92633023062376
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how	131.80022193846946
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr	146.61684006887413
Bingley	1.0
"I am sick of Mr	12.961333243965608
Bingley," cried his wife	53.85475537031962
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before	54.04356220354497
If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him	89.80480170895959
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now	98.92228754457605
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs	112.23250008081047
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while	69.50400074491654
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr	73.62408122094219
Bennet	1.0
But I knew I should
persuade you at last	53.34519046511938
I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance	181.1918277294381
Well, how pleased I am	52.38894701541847
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now	84.60340255960783
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr	132.8654410244782
Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife	59.45589633588349
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut	117.98682017574559
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter	74.30195666570376
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing	127.11118639294182
Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr	91.90671820309653
Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball	58.82482792013428
"Oh	1.0
said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest	48.761331759744806
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr	109.35614919478691
Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner	142.15857073026314
CHAPTER III	31.267591934088102
Not all that Mrs	37.157380475259
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr	147.19796672795675
Bingley	1.0
They attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
Lady Lucas	113.45153290031546
Her report was highly favourable	215.56545758940126
Sir William had been
delighted with him	21.52641725034315
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party	91.43828367068976
Nothing could be more delightful	42.78600140165835
To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr	219.51148967461717
Bingley's heart were entertained	162.69241119249608
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs	93.0225346348315
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for	81.05817117571478
In a few days Mr	28.009761156401773
Bingley returned Mr	60.33989053184081
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library	69.58772634464181
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father	102.91299514024689
The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	121.71595986130082
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
Mrs	92.71248530440673
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all	256.4638068313388
Mr	1.0
Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c	80.76698652745134
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was quite
disconcerted	309.45280278609727
She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be	85.62221531957714
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr	108.63241654285439
Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	201.81865173623802
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin	480.7208244643097
And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr	561.4999189419084
Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man	163.0663199263773
Mr	1.0
Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners	140.58614975940094
His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion	256.549800856206
His brother-in-law, Mr	72.17326419753272
Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr	135.32532597188327
Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year	147.4030802600708
The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr	67.34532907126075
Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend	140.50741476734393
Mr	1.0
Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield	191.28736557773593
Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves	286.48887130378654
What a contrast between him and his friend	79.29394246308543
Mr	1.0
Darcy danced
only once with Mrs	109.41763163819488
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party	154.1287740156199
His character was decided	45.433245246463
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again	68.59774650825683
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs	96.01266724870402
Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters	207.78521984757845
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr	117.61530057409566
Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr	98.87620234533973
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it	64.77885760489664
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance	150.18395705187902
I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	284.910219600251
You had much better
dance	53.70617427131168
"I certainly shall not	47.55503412834417
You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner	96.05550755974822
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable	82.48205570160692
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with	52.6268375072773
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a
kingdom	88.99813091172446
Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty	144.5129854082772
"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr	107.23697088581865
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet	58.45672370050852
"Oh	1.0
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld	129.8733476689735
But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say, very agreeable	95.21319841583583
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you	99.62798372659259
"Which do you mean	26.695137402566203
and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men	177.87770994121473
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me	107.75256812416691
Mr	1.0
Bingley followed his advice	78.5565348632542
Mr	1.0
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	177.14911457232213
She told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous	169.9617050361374
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	332.03515060197606
Mrs	1.0
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party	64.81026425460314
Mr	1.0
Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters	63.18050862971897
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way	68.66100602419586
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure	38.31344457630972
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball	107.72287954613621
They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants	182.91529536439458
They found Mr	37.526784561852715
Bennet still up	56.1951556733215
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations	153.2762273602868
He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear	107.61515618032652
"Oh	1.0
my dear Mr	13.246607175751276
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball	131.42795143340558
I wish you had been there	58.052910162144066
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it	88.07620909390711
Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr	68.85295900886835
Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice	582.3577696551081
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time	172.40654879933217
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas	111.65719082206141
I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance	112.95065585798733
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next	162.37818689111526
Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"

"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much	111.26058674828431
For God's sake, say no more of
his partners	90.14864390351167
Oh	1.0
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	38.53517822986165
"Oh	1.0
my dear," continued Mrs	32.79701923388109
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him	43.897082592487834
He
is so excessively handsome	46.01131947249652
and his sisters are charming women	168.1172909388457
I never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	86.21454990320686
I dare say the
lace upon Mrs	44.46749794221348
Hurst's gown----"

Here she was interrupted again	40.76039635309065
Mr	1.0
Bennet protested against any
description of finery	132.37205461279214
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr	158.3692851936032
Darcy	1.0
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing	128.31835440382972
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him	98.34780252621258
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great	224.99001206239063
Not handsome enough to dance with	65.10230405066203
I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs	108.21010783769208
I quite detest the man	992.7076450074139
CHAPTER IV	47.15195378156759
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr	111.06336943587446
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him	122.27191952144733
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners	107.28810227019665
--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding	148.29343877600374
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can	152.3656550425634
His character is thereby complete	82.03967971187582
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	65.66099900366483
I
did not expect such a compliment	29.952740274021846
"Did not you	5.694731070019949
_I_ did for you	29.909072544809053
But that is one great difference between
us	73.31835873048897
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never	143.23284661649066
What
could be more natural than his asking you again	96.07675972509581
He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room	102.71650286496899
No thanks to his gallantry for that	82.64169777914054
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him	93.79649761358735
You have liked many a
stupider person	81.33757403391066
"Dear Lizzy	2.180634471664868
"Oh	1.0
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general	64.16601946565034
You never see a fault in any body	75.55122752247767
All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes	109.50984126658443
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	72.08355152408515
"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
what I think	118.13897575304227
"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	110.2560440295554
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others	153.19723933654248
Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where	234.10259857918578
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone	89.73954143712164
And so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you	227.87143055024268
Their manners are not equal to his	49.472714744736216
"Certainly not; at first	20.783158937099998
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them	67.43423223674408
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her	65.97503178682207
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them	156.29038972007305
They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited	211.77251489129262
They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others	124.55976013581171
They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade	187.04475163320134
Mr	1.0
Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it	119.29679790936538
--Mr	1.0
Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase	147.61570850997222
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs	77.63695781624664
Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her	127.02677806834899
Mr	1.0
Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at Netherfield House	146.7227621140554
He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately	86.26263206790894
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character	50.09066877977774
--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied	127.73334512400305
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion	148.3469099553035
In
understanding Darcy was the superior	825.3909918441367
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever	142.83815216059895
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting	137.2551116412156
In
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	129.87873531621491
Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence	376.5141457346033
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic	391.86398917034984
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful	126.99279485557375
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure	233.58269153574153
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much	111.05296731050012
Mrs	1.0
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of	109.44653949503278
Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose	159.28115884293643
CHAPTER V	44.91202906605083
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate	282.1715999346663
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty	114.54727521757482
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	2431.9748637307193
It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	127.56096441603508
For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body	96.03710595114285
By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St	237.78371038981703
James's had made him
courteous	32.99806647824646
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs	82.96238323483855
Bennet	1.0
--They had several children	41.200707616205456
The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend	418.6803569052462
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate	158.30521823472674
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs	138.62898445721606
Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas	66.04881840895402
"_You_ were Mr	51.747729991282554
Bingley's first choice	136.14736643897538
"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better	171.603128941297
"Oh	1.0
--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice	151.01097985641596
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr	188.83460743406462
Robinson	1.0
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr	82.51209374579253
Robinson; did not
I mention it to you	34.69290421913748
Mr	1.0
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest	101.33483791404313
and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh	102.99691859229773
the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point	213.0345035121648
"Upon my word	35.48863849772968
--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know	139.9027844112977
"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte	189.9764305683952
"Mr	1.0
Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he	133.2941461562034
--Poor Eliza	25.36671432048638
--to be only just _tolerable_	89.24486486320922
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him	94.30073755344921
Mrs	1.0
Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	197.79014788443268
"Are you quite sure, Ma'am	485.2173478744343
--is not there a little mistake	93.38215976814816
said
Jane	5.942102899679004
--"I certainly saw Mr	78.03049205963926
Darcy speaking to her	36.36667440396976
"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to	124.93647776749481
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance	218.58315140592288
With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable	81.38427089288676
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear	36.88556676740353
If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs	36.62003848403382
Long	1.0
But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs	94.84440773794964
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise	79.37217440518617
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs	94.79915503048166
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza	151.75380925908073
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you	95.58130754211697
"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him	78.7374182742588
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it	107.4055635104457
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself	262.44353924642536
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud	80.6544010589454
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_	68.24654701142158
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe	158.37975322986068
By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary	95.7627356225358
Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously	277.9679934575155
A person may be
proud without being vain	133.11263615920998
Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us	424.1504281742933
"If I were as rich as Mr	106.35216066665988
Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was	128.44675056063147
I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day	125.58063174235564
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs	68.8716108030369
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle
directly	139.50669684713466
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit	162.3214481082779
CHAPTER VI	43.529276357152554
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield	131.41937742766305
The visit
was returned in due form	239.93496379343097
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of Mrs	90.0234893641549
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest	96.44209631357974
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration	174.09237015999352
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent	115.40976028118426
She mentioned this to her friend Miss
Lucas	79.31842441705744
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded	85.23656703799075
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark	123.52467646707905
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself	96.6291242810985
We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement	162.74731776979576
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels	178.1062891875585
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on	209.6599617842089
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow	196.55718047824462
If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too	89.64790517282597
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do	67.5776943604494
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out	86.75321305915206
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her	57.006796716394824
But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together	174.2951240622078
Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention	206.1808811601326
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses	79.81566829358486
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it	145.15323539412236
But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design	149.5253542137498
As yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness	113.84884361602171
She has known him only a fortnight	92.10440554872237
She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times	154.3404703001115
This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character	43.56598020027817
"Not as you represent it	75.89824909724638
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal	124.83019240524347
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded	114.75465296213015
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth	117.11885960681445
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	126.34181210974157
If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least	119.12382246309835
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life	145.20499378855922
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound	186.11091653640375
You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself	57.036504069847254
Occupied in observing Mr	35.54529648814888
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend	93.6929342636224
Mr	1.0
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise	132.45298372927363
But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	148.37406680413847
To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	3008.5114496635206
Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness	112.85710811761122
Of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with	154.08952784711457
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others	149.16748104423587
His doing so
drew her notice	138.8159284521457
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled	77.93489754905112
"What does Mr	73.71483958837091
Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster	186.0356852800473
"That is a question which Mr	29.927494360027065
Darcy only can answer	52.82469486094559
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about	135.27346295341704
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him	90.44382731031334
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"Did not you think, Mr	117.86265861698573
Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton	201.93571853552572
"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic	71.62372047050397
"You are severe on us	359.30214281253285
"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas	137.91934776134252
"I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows	55.24103544530803
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend	60.53395254779838
--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body	72.59331752770856
--If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers	117.41781209023291
On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must	84.90633713171171
And gravely glancing
at Mr	212.03759414534812
Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song	221.33927508198522
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital	199.4240300646167
After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display	276.83874422792996
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached	167.4668602056107
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room	124.48273745218722
Mr	1.0
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began	126.698958280112
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr	127.13529009485497
Darcy	1.0
--There
is nothing like dancing after all	74.53225133583634
--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies	107.4037283560221
"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world	92.78553538271477
--Every savage can
dance	47.87259952506858
Sir William only smiled	57.054062984742764
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr	149.7671566137146
Darcy	1.0
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir	118.08313704537694
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	76.05687358927213
Do
you often dance at St	61.51495801853154
James's	1.0
"Never, sir	42.55487970194612
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	53.120099272236665
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it	74.05705461126226
"You have a house in town, I conclude	59.78363462721992
Mr	1.0
Darcy bowed	58.90786269683909
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas	236.22100064215257
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing	113.32120965056575
--Mr	1.0
Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner	134.50636327399437
--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you	96.66631137098265
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr	78.31396109210144
Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing	153.14263256178504
--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner	113.98763942883714
Mr	1.0
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain	159.85434112733725
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	149.2927970713479
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour	120.37403189296059
"Mr	1.0
Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling	88.97066490375578
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner	138.13219572572942
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away	37.79461948571274
Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,

"I can guess the subject of your reverie	87.91391684240477
"I should imagine not	76.98688499220127
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion	116.97588709411167
I was never more annoyed	26.470000276088285
The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people	112.13981867150882
--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them	95.94040560625582
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you	129.71784163527903
My mind was more
agreeably engaged	108.7000329605745
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	96.03155585806054
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	142.86361393319115
Mr	1.0
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet	87.93481879171281
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet	53.11648778861659
repeated Miss Bingley	27.099387399482943
"I am all astonishment	47.61992376207823
How long has she been such a favourite	67.72243273302254
--and pray when am I to wish you
joy	383.18018343431976
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask	77.17108005652548
A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment	189.8366690056694
I knew you would be wishing me joy	46.5370614036779
"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled	123.00440843252326
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you	50.251989423424625
He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long	205.01012109680116
CHAPTER VII	54.98634585633872
Mr	1.0
Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his	170.29791391493836
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds	72.03689060888782
She had a sister married to a Mr	180.75613440277382
Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade	86.94596399725097
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way	179.77163733311517
The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt	263.80375349847947
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters	182.15969030848976
Their visits to Mrs	189.68085306130362
Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence	67.34695079366114
Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections	220.0305456773645
Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves	81.42420343012311
Mr	1.0
Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before	148.908712826437
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr	67.54459006809951
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign	211.14593721743486
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr	455.12617250072634
Bennet coolly observed,

"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country	89.19100673849907
I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced	53.422727317217294
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London	86.55554128730188
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs	24.921376870240906
Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly	88.15960047636733
If I wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however	68.84360761879603
"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it	107.13424004269842
"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever	102.43622741449596
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree	76.61051410721478
I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish	106.3121701601836
"My dear Mr	13.246607175751276
Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother	93.34992533751158
--When they get to our age I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do	146.30457013184613
I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
regimentals	267.76680113938124
"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library	137.8777122173284
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer	145.2018491981004
Mrs	1.0
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from	122.47304111217491
what is it about	44.304727261656964
what does he say	195.61417337769905
Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love	70.79136012767994
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud	69.79892973236824
"My dear Friend,

     "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel	171.56932720189118
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this	56.75809402696947
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	44.102582756653355
Yours ever,

     "CAROLINE BINGLEY	4058.121132983889
"With the officers	16.507808118871598
cried Lydia	11.455470701575369
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_	52.51820629576704
"Dining out," said Mrs	18.13878374660014
Bennet, "that is very unlucky	32.440842359101616
"Can I have the carriage	28.701240845182365
said Jane	5.942102899679004
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night	179.70086858656146
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home	71.43541290546409
"Oh	1.0
but the gentlemen will have Mr	67.41206487138041
Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs	122.17970875308224
"I had much rather go in the coach	81.00464292273678
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure	75.83467779878791
They are
wanted in the farm, Mr	54.20157458779942
Bennet, are not they	40.98728119335982
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them	91.13501597287829
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered	105.4480203002906
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged	54.65099720553073
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day	141.8616110947049
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard	162.27983225004536
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted	93.95050759852285
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back	154.24973571445565
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed	166.7600769228392
said Mrs	5.028075492009886
Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	88.42554294112728
Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance	44.92208159695105
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

     "My dearest Lizzy,

     "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	277.905854936368
My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better	142.85572260833587
They insist also on
     my seeing Mr	197.02747490568714
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me	67.01859146541612
"Yours, &c	1.042784185590511
"Well, my dear," said Mr	32.884254843582376
Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr	102.67015031556939
Bingley, and under your orders	101.08134994413825
"Oh	1.0
I am not at all afraid of her dying	30.811869794428258
People do not die of little
trifling colds	172.0968035616392
She will be taken good care of	103.58023179732075
As long as she stays
there, it is all very well	54.78244149299683
I would go and see her, if I could have the
carriage	57.051698423924755
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative	134.44601778982477
She declared her resolution	44.47501696659778
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt	63.68362145093277
You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there	44.49755171045089
"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want	47.1232381198288
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses	80.99567954801864
"No, indeed	44.21900728093234
I do not wish to avoid the walk	29.146207745552566
The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles	316.036822707381
I shall be back by dinner	113.71150082543238
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	243.95089752558968
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia	106.19731519487654
--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together	116.37715481805007
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes	113.6991829774722
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise	151.97975090946613
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise	90.94067510727272
--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs	133.7683901274694
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it	69.51647601089925
She was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness	180.52067314380315
--Mr	1.0
Darcy said very
little, and Mr	71.23907540188792
Hurst nothing at all	45.544249319440745
The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone	201.84953281994993
The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast	215.73560616116825
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	105.9535793410793
Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room	87.42630422347003
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance	126.68492911955201
She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with	124.32598041791657
Elizabeth silently attended
her	41.106814501079285
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for Jane	136.99252646959718
The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts	161.80214114812654
The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely	432.62897940905145
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere	174.23101504956475
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so	128.93034927117088
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present	192.1495873344118
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes	166.17988990552746
CHAPTER VIII	40.271554161662635
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner	297.0823187325565
To the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr	228.04754957375266
Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer	37.069711913899155
Jane was by no means better	63.13296812026869
The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	358.55426945015137
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency	154.19133717365557
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others	99.90119908842746
She had very little notice from any but him	149.78206409074429
Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr	33.33707469161186
Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr	131.6054369660891
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her	117.62123141577402
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	115.56482304480532
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty	147.18457908637106
Mrs	1.0
Hurst
thought the same, and added,

"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker	276.9782793844157
I shall never forget her appearance this morning	76.23326671782081
She really
looked almost wild	116.85939893844665
"She did indeed, Louisa	241.65227599832437
I could hardly keep my countenance	55.25052316101357
Very
nonsensical to come at all	35.342100813689925
Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold	94.69294623643552
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy	25.98058649651609
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office	175.99663939753702
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me	166.75019409353675
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning	108.4483397342411
Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice	788.6587220816003
"_You_ observed it, Mr	191.18744453108025
Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition	39.28656756516967
"Certainly not	6.7308830094413965
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone	173.66855928625452
what could she mean by
it	73.8371214240831
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum	268.5304718199605
"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley	75.94456203753978
"I am afraid, Mr	18.84946960868623
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes	264.35498209629714
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise	38.609982235605486
--A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs	60.3894169079699
Hurst began again	49.197171495914105
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled	117.8616324839624
But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it	76.5289459126806
"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton	67.97924598919269
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside	526.4739134168658
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily	121.69045533170524
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable	108.54522203166562
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied Darcy	91.87547465709204
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations	269.7669114377012
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee	100.41086530809277
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself	89.63150029653497
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book	170.87905590738117
Mr	1.0
Hurst looked at her with astonishment	49.59621889150804
"Do you prefer reading to cards	145.63156678659496
said he; "that is rather singular	77.94520262626558
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards	149.97355117913025
She is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else	60.34975212150026
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things	291.5180474079257
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	74.50411443231357
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying	74.38640809773487
He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded	172.49261021132688
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into	107.18230829249995
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room	92.01551409441049
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books	144.1219974233776
--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr	337.2237858999677
Darcy	1.0
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations	49.06920729734896
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books	127.290153931143
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these	147.15038526392598
"Neglect	1.0
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place	106.58333020677499
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley	90.35753887602534
"I wish it may	33.12508647947748
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model	136.66329210997063
There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire	87.03329723386253
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it	110.26033090988831
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles	94.94226833974626
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation	210.99168487675595
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr	133.29588820366763
Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game	73.03006311580556
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring	200.174888340073
said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am	123.67276947409259
"I think she will	24.681341223295007
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller	159.50528860204662
"How I long to see her again	58.60587288652001
I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much	119.40717667777486
Such a countenance, such manners	209.66421596997742
and so extremely
accomplished for her age	98.23956675084906
Her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite	91.98286934842716
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are	112.55506277882627
"All young ladies accomplished	78.68945282024539
My dear Charles, what do you mean	38.63543214300066
"Yes, all of them, I think	53.1362259845531
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses	62.7420222025548
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished	101.52250343361004
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth	139.8479348531951
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen	118.53619480528349
But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	68.59173307767313
I
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished	84.90501364754701
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley	30.391958446063786
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman	136.81071671114034
"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it	38.95177699121966
"Oh	1.0
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with	182.85385524695184
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved	195.9791772167592
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading	219.65887831955007
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women	940.7899983399433
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_	393.88464634299373
"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this	133.25007402225432
"_I_ never saw such a woman	23.56385653186986
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united	87.7881172954109
Mrs	1.0
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr	244.46338782365757
Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	158.05336302708915
As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room	153.50171052081032
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds	140.03317785255848
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art	249.97018239102812
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation	126.85838256934476
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable	33.985077491257904
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject	57.02517608469206
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her	69.86493468131206
Bingley urged Mr	128.22662004569142
Jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians	186.26808536309738
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr	69.37827181680102
Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better	90.56442192956705
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable	284.1195342680413
They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	188.0953867867217
CHAPTER IX	39.68442416583136
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr	107.04225953524703
Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters	124.659248323179
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation	103.70568516538489
The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with	254.99918345961748
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast	217.533427987411
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs	278.22786282742004
Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield	188.9533336009104
She
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable	206.4225028835351
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour	182.6495486746544
Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs	269.64646860447624
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected	64.22805878292749
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer	84.62605458382141
"She is a great deal too ill to be
moved	73.58741945763822
Mr	1.0
Jones says we must not think of moving her	281.39899613932056
We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness	137.88525441710837
"Removed	1.0
cried Bingley	7.598146850241435
"It must not be thought of	18.89305604569309
My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal	42.58834144326983
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us	112.62923984215072
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	38.516905655046294
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with	78.77881722533915
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_	143.98049470609774
You have a sweet room here, Mr	126.50619063823584
Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk	47.61417751591336
I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield	50.138933178639356
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
hope, though you have but a short lease	89.0073056767182
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes	212.11233988152415
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here	239.69129082097226
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth	29.471260102676894
"You begin to comprehend me, do you	83.24407632948532
cried he, turning towards her	83.8096126758095
"Oh	1.0
yes--I understand you perfectly	141.24485274881377
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful	111.88310977785439
"That is as it happens	49.44264782083409
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	171.04682350017373
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	74.69367302170018
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character	87.76387875885634
It must be an amusing study	53.05637787488303
"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing	138.25512728933114
They have at
least that advantage	172.1060846196883
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study	276.1007259516836
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society	160.2655441727624
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever	168.19580919529238
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs	15.517698156788644
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood	185.7898932507091
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town	71.43559409836415
Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away	260.51284489431725
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph	268.76788731902315
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places	148.06446240915676
The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr	96.57379809174874
Bingley	1.0
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town it is pretty much the same	57.939568548441635
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either	186.26573817194762
"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition	54.0994501066195
But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all	97.31018443459509
"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother	91.01026215733431
"You quite mistook Mr	35.245982862392154
Darcy	1.0
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true	110.08579594600721
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger	202.0444772212952
I know we dine with four and twenty families	131.21401756250123
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance	105.18777239429622
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr	186.0339960268222
Darcy with a very expressive smile	122.05911255143334
Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away	154.51230311382497
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father	59.084588806435875
What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr	95.57282448447029
Bingley--is not he	53.915105118911036
so much the man of fashion	40.279572486905906
so
genteel and so easy	58.03947517705627
--He has always something to say to every
body	52.05058937187082
--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter	387.38968768287737
"Did Charlotte dine with you	140.97261545134847
"No, she would go home	55.181345667802226
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	49.81756691519693
For
my part, Mr	63.87724959216666
Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently	286.08217442143064
But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you	97.59557469246991
It is a pity they are not handsome	43.07770741582429
Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	137.12367200154299
"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley	86.20535570363246
"Oh	1.0
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain	118.30076955866897
Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty	272.7439001164964
I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body
better looking	84.12279865815933
It is what every body says	46.77212433210041
I do not trust my own
partiality	41.179760060190404
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	168.91182018065192
But however he did not	14.344868191409386
Perhaps he thought her too young	84.18939412161458
However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were	87.94483048287513
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently	130.64561620017136
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way	97.25100008497192
I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love	199.35872848653997
"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy	58.1543648863934
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may	213.4135198386002
Every thing nourishes what is
strong already	40.720097555164465
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	143.36695353823134
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	175.2393835961772
She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs	67.45436201459971
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr	191.52622427402812
Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy	114.3031848784763
Mr	1.0
Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required	157.9901496137575
She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs	299.83982921820336
Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage	69.41860381112546
Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward	201.2843925893032
The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr	98.42843784919437
Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield	112.46518738301717
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age	173.46793682590203
She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance	141.5892967135564
She was very
equal therefore to address Mr	99.57816468907846
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	90.85841275416786
His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear	188.567658816458
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball	119.06632360220432
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	66.76334068130845
Lydia declared herself satisfied	101.76277444944577
"Oh	1.0
yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again	91.99001140146181
And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also	92.95859299445745
I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	75.0004845890351
Mrs	1.0
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr	117.53758688421578
Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_	77.86475194561267
CHAPTER X	36.142694885019736
The day passed much as the day before had done	101.17838091797282
Mrs	1.0
Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room	111.63304517578187
The loo table, however, did not appear	216.1595207436852
Mr	1.0
Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister	145.72639842396055
Mr	1.0
Hurst and Mr	17.95434601097921
Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs	29.235600457900308
Hurst was observing their game	460.8105207468195
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion	168.39094388875247
The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each	134.842571836087
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter	77.07224196329253
He made no answer	25.031604334072295
"You write uncommonly fast	114.82654847912245
"You are mistaken	53.73661918171851
I write rather slowly	316.25496611493253
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year	64.78611929004263
Letters of business too	92.5885200850029
How odious I should think them	91.59786807617515
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	116.73174369192662
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her	42.32032636053766
"I have already told her so once, by your desire	119.10149932256195
"I am afraid you do not like your pen	23.99352638293639
Let me mend it for you	39.11801702064017
I mend
pens remarkably well	129.94201218904914
"Thank you--but I always mend my own	37.196417196448856
"How can you contrive to write so even	73.58805624728872
He was silent	18.358840883020203
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's	82.66577344616768
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again	119.80510736744186
--At
present I have not room to do them justice	140.68214502655465
"Oh	1.0
it is of no consequence	63.179739657636716
I shall see her in January	57.71307865858739
But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr	338.94754792997117
Darcy	1.0
"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine	101.96767294440971
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill	199.3858573783881
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease	99.29174593969007
He studies too much for
words of four syllables	121.6146891575787
--Do not you, Darcy	22.63042334483854
"My style of writing is very different from yours	121.45996388464538
"Oh	1.0
cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable	181.05565356566882
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest	124.25287200094728
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	124.47693499209065
"Your humility, Mr	186.00727838596677
Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof	54.05558594232662
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility	125.31721588164457
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast	723.2445520496822
"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty	393.3037577960233
"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting	226.5529371660476
The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance	114.96149245522902
When you told Mrs	23.57622501615152
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	166.96131914890836
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning	135.67350155998676
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment	112.95117284403652
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	330.4859721859987
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity	48.998720168847
Your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month	191.46454182009927
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr	90.70276753006361
Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition	52.71498416029414
You have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself	167.71785705964535
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	210.49237002735808
But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could	109.01254751247443
"Would Mr	25.281704195054523
Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it	113.42137819911078
"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself	440.74227132850694
"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged	164.0358000961784
Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety	165.3350699428802
"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you	78.79795612729866
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either	111.26061558041988
"You appear to me, Mr	57.0516586924884
Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection	166.88189547780834
A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it	284.5311336432733
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr	60.796608250238144
Bingley	1.0
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon	115.22574438498113
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it	144.32499560438606
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties	110.56627123597698
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of	134.52961234101195
I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference	153.1349385639941
I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do	158.54393598918776
Mr	1.0
Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh	143.4459034872764
Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense	187.3604015527989
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend	145.16163736485586
--"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this	160.31820006181454
"Perhaps I do	7.967147757378786
Arguments are too much like disputes	24.907226691439313
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me	87.04049742515143
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr	88.48368181118671
Darcy had much better finish his letter	55.98893243344436
Mr	1.0
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	213.09609708424074
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music	121.50721630592902
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself	262.969614128494
Mrs	1.0
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr	160.59394684685276
Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her	36.876864800163204
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange	95.01044434622835
She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present	281.74139263383535
The supposition did not pain her	97.12488497323982
She liked
him too little to care for his approbation	103.47491798285897
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr	136.15403660453472
Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her--

"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel	92.63767827825583
She smiled, but made no answer	81.94102979101298
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence	159.23862048086264
"Oh	1.0
said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply	89.50182691836838
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt	117.7087518718239
I have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare	112.85759787202755
"Indeed I do not dare	28.02735100565719
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	127.17998843370604
He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger	78.0278851264643
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth	159.53636034431017
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance	254.38653369805223
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers	93.24371539239435
--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses	311.42822329297434
"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity	88.3469204882294
"Oh	1.0
yes	1.0
--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley	76.00376229402475
Put them next to your great uncle
the judge	214.407379381593
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines	133.0386870790386
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	181.86506633568072
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied	166.69913039143893
At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs	113.66362207301582
Hurst and
Elizabeth herself	38.30388528130847
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard	95.84879668416882
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs	211.2904713451064
Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out	152.77892365162154
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr	164.26408975215753
Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself	129.8414149657752
The path just admitted three	793.6955991540689
Mr	1.0
Darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"This walk is not wide enough for our party	255.48216237035797
We had better go into the
avenue	29.864600953480423
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are	161.50606934728634
--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage	257.49428380910433
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth	74.45960833090191
Good bye	14.047654827744326
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two	97.24561564253331
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	180.54298453156773
CHAPTER XI	48.79236161531385
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	117.34816756525264
Their powers of conversation were considerable	505.4027518498895
They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit	373.6868802536098
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object	58.47748343331602
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	131.1128957920157
He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr	88.54579124666775
Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation	100.2577662321781
He was full of joy and
attention	118.76172140248846
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door	83.19995710333868
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else	73.1862548818719
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight	103.80455267411517
When tea was over, Mr	125.53108011453664
Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain	66.07802130567117
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr	172.65695943599115
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr	60.28516946636805
Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected	442.4382501594163
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her	87.8559099221417
Mr	1.0
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep	186.83952455212196
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs	138.63347133768735
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet	92.18276977683588
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr	60.39411933306491
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page	205.5136596402829
She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on	96.39910262816447
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way	142.50705239085826
I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading	156.78470023771104
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book	51.445423013763985
--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library	70.24173019440941
No one made any reply	45.96104236984535
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield	169.48484458540634
--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure	135.62030151789438
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards	133.38014793342975
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	76.76632828201662
It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day	281.65982667286653
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball	87.68826686657064
Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room	42.84620189728968
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious	102.5021299632927
In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room	115.07563667390276
--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude	108.48973446115072
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately	70.22888170501194
Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr	114.05720899171125
Darcy looked
up	18.60602606697507
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book	131.4984973005983
He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere	172.73531497218949
"What could he mean	78.63802894362502
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him	94.63359372055706
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it	116.56585798071418
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr	81.47515206863453
Darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives	103.82743132767065
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak	73.97934858562247
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire	179.439415519835
"Oh	1.0
shocking	1.0
cried Miss Bingley	19.913065028598297
"I never heard any thing so
abominable	66.20587267451079
How shall we punish him for such a speech	84.60619539347864
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth	85.09897379627249
"We
can all plague and punish one another	262.93249787829626
Teaze him--laugh at
him	28.753687850869014
--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done	37.69517750880975
"But upon my honour I do _not_	54.92416867154528
I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_	72.30899344148963
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind	119.90150530867494
No,
no--I feel he may defy us there	141.30249873863292
And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject	122.25589538919502
Mr	1.0
Darcy may hug himself	76.6839424877278
"Mr	1.0
Darcy is not to be laughed at	45.98501463213557
cried Elizabeth	2.634894999603702
"That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance	104.29666599172812
I dearly love a
laugh	434.86483721669896
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be	61.0078170127051
The
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke	237.283136489209
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_	62.610439084661
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good	72.95904106627401
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can	111.38525329270155
--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without	56.87642152654124
"Perhaps that is not possible for any one	54.149094940812915
But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule	131.8963920636701
"Such as vanity and pride	148.77740406692445
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed	205.75095429824592
But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation	57.65985034747767
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	48.1420624051535
"Your examination of Mr	30.273555392415705
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result	242.5624798738367
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr	36.247506000652166
Darcy has no defect	105.70002305525797
He owns it
himself without disguise	355.6444999295301
"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension	178.10757210951346
I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding	65.64393986738655
My temper I dare not vouch
for	119.09980496365762
--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world	52.09971058130195
I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself	133.6583358880181
My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	100.36048462493373
My temper
would perhaps be called resentful	130.58810938330717
--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever	165.48830894779408
"_That_ is a failing indeed	51.38404001333137
--cried Elizabeth	2.634894999603702
"Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character	78.68510536117175
But you have chosen your fault well	300.6578353162633
--I
really cannot _laugh_ at it	95.44889178833073
You are safe from me	146.45321135510065
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome	277.46389450937073
"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body	74.09576914791172
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them	162.4559796998755
"Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share	70.68515331327293
--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr	56.38198847425599
Hurst	1.0
Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it	114.2019971989894
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention	62.62014182703843
CHAPTER XII	43.021281467720314
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day	69.70401729997646
But Mrs	16.86162275813253
Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before	151.33665386135874
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home	114.62298092064351
Mrs	1.0
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr	127.71708181501255
Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well	166.39050922818268
--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr	266.98665594382544
Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made	133.3390605068099
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred	203.69320392938118
Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	124.64564645060128
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right	82.94966132572327
To Mr	15.977427655529677
Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough	66.01210691152504
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself	99.249005480401
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it	151.19555025510695
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her	101.11027513801011
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place	201.75745521715396
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former	110.69392413834102
--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	55.76232733943694
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	145.12728685303108
Mrs	1.0
Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again	216.3441364777531
--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle	147.54245624333225
The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth	127.98158420962757
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to	157.5181935240308
Catherine and Lydia had
information for them of a different sort	78.22608714113062
Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married	93.0449078457944
CHAPTER XIII	50.811904919547814
"I hope, my dear," said Mr	42.28806783607206
Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party	97.474501874076
"Who do you mean, my dear	36.563095995534695
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her	142.60145497285174
I do not believe she often sees such at home	80.3891399900042
"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger	66.65805614080017
Mrs	1.0
Bennet's eyes sparkled	22.449376721595495
--"A gentleman and a stranger	41.82838505936542
It is Mr	18.19831373727552
Bingley
I am sure	7.124299426239806
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing	120.48298937687288
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr	22.63962034327692
Bingley	1.0
--But--good
lord	102.93348003123383
how unlucky	11.87489352488188
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day	91.02115210811006
Lydia,
my love, ring the bell	275.4674084169887
I must speak to Hill, this moment	90.29995161869576
"It is _not_ Mr	21.9017256332868
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life	53.23879310919459
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	100.57268440672512
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained	235.29839152482003
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention	175.45498676303802
It is from my cousin, Mr	36.20578543606251
Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	76.48430664722748
"Oh	1.0
my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned	69.91454850189618
Pray do not talk of that odious man	79.84627512477803
I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it	91.51914228157194
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	97.8100670060317
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs	70.42833944617111
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	150.62014239485157
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr	80.07740311763509
Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr	52.60838895292363
Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn	292.3618932922287
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself	97.81148001690573
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical	43.759331847510154
I hate such false
friends	742.6501078474621
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him	182.5741075043758
"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear	156.2547152468855
_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,

     15th October	86.20307846623191
_

     DEAR SIR,

     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance	132.20410802237637
--"There, Mrs	91.16216018604085
Bennet	1.0
--My mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the Church of England	116.61194863336088
As a clergyman, moreover, I
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	160.4083239918957
I cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter	80.23790816513299
If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day	184.46142920578075
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     WILLIAM COLLINS	256.75653901495673
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr	211.9471522439446
Bennet, as he folded up the letter	42.10196609432343
"He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again	99.43543165532355
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him	104.00330723103384
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit	169.96223541447117
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required	92.37161794073965
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she	30.47758125120638
"I cannot make him
out	37.97444743510266
--There is something very pompous in his style	86.58169724185085
--And what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail	110.49864223910173
--We cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could	74.29304257144169
--Can he be a sensible man, sir	142.33891612550707
"No, my dear; I think not	42.97332694124286
I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse	50.07197078204032
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well	62.54679044194739
I am impatient to see him	28.711958628231507
"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective	198.44981707441582
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed	101.49180978788503
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting	352.1190512293372
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	96.99207143598235
As for
their mother, Mr	101.46108878725242
Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters	86.5336112198474
Mr	1.0
Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family	86.26015250496457
Mr	1.0
Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr	167.54841936723577
Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself	123.22742593626974
He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty	89.14761031381273
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal	125.85798543458812
He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs	143.40227430963986
Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	219.73465523980207
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs	78.16054488413867
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough	104.33791659834282
Things are settled so
oddly	28.571332810433518
"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	64.69262356564806
"Ah	1.0
sir, I do indeed	28.500682382078715
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess	124.02769029928658
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world	196.43432861255704
There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed	163.8199465254572
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate	66.12089496159233
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them	53.46166684749004
At present I will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other	125.06773677045346
They were not the only objects of Mr	179.62841956591367
Collins's admiration	51.233460506759414
The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs	113.89028430764576
Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property	224.6856611439795
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing	143.05048793493964
But here he was set right by Mrs	180.912309723854
Bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	47.112779974352975
He begged
pardon for having displeased her	182.72357833577362
In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour	149.5045813869953
CHAPTER XIV	46.23386779260451
During dinner, Mr	48.32268051277901
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	140.5845783845925
Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable	149.88993410943462
Mr	1.0
Bennet could not have chosen
better	31.530179882379294
Mr	1.0
Collins was eloquent in her praise	111.55731625009649
The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine	158.03464962167988
She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her	58.51036280273383
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening	113.18316373280247
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	80.13786393240045
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations	119.02456795980656
She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs	104.98961123263834
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs	78.37279817160751
Bennet, "and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman	83.43106305449767
It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her	123.98279304329373
Does she live near you, sir	202.6514873643527
"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence	193.27006701731003
"I think you said she was a widow, sir	55.075783133543474
has she any family	106.79135432548757
"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property	139.87422607443173
"Ah	1.0
cried Mrs	4.666307015188249
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls	198.3037767279884
And what sort of young lady is she	71.32445641769445
is she handsome	169.09565621387247
"She is a most charming young lady indeed	87.58305284707959
Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth	179.86088447237023
She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them	121.2995169571904
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	175.47381889548478
"Has she been presented	121.13558945237958
I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court	94.92230531544847
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British court of its brightest ornament	311.03312751306333
Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies	193.29892304073798
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her	92.11177196027322
--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay	193.54758931376227
"You judge very properly," said Mr	267.56770303910866
Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	176.25619252340786
May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study	186.67798976026054
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible	157.61192848256198
Mr	1.0
Bennet's expectations were fully answered	158.20746792690738
His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure	123.22650750801405
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr	47.748661485702925
Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	109.15661614881968
Mr	1.0
Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels	163.6268547070681
--Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed	100.3398270626586
--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce's Sermons	317.84736802635274
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him	139.93730323569477
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday	71.42243441806035
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr	90.80955325870273
Denny comes back from town	179.0660227421456
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr	100.51074662340442
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit	267.7983590798111
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction	158.02473024108428
But I will no longer importune my young cousin	78.70761048317124
Then turning to Mr	61.91153374938833
Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon	201.77338985227445
Mr	1.0
Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	178.47917234990007
Mrs	1.0
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr	108.31637360387899
Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr	291.9596140530796
Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon	177.89170749218886
CHAPTER XV	42.39216444237812
Mr	1.0
Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance	174.97586530159842
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity	134.70618615465145
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility	99.31480318940464
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	148.97049134517155
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part	135.69933516661771
His plan did not vary on seeing them	92.06360605978175
--Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice	133.59680577533288
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs	103.25404918988738
Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on	203.28832779398408
--"As to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged	98.29416786207034
Mr	1.0
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs	79.31877759863276
Bennet was stirring the fire	26.074015880087245
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course	175.17592002793305
Mrs	1.0
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces	78.51916799674581
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr	159.42514665094038
Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr	77.34222387447456
Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr	85.29933737694644
Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr	95.55169992176216
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford	83.3288137849323
Such
doings discomposed Mr	80.8092659471264
Bennet exceedingly	23.446188662418763
In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr	135.30832289659355
Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr	105.07189834508078
Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go	156.77194372555724
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton	172.99377168958569
The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_	115.93819830417884
Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them	157.02887748569958
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way	109.47452867206219
The officer was the very
Mr	151.40025018793278
Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed	208.91742499713268
All were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot	182.38208157495802
Mr	1.0
Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr	93.21011561324868
Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps	135.19754638367166
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming	99.99398560814095
His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address	179.66274786495072
The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street	158.70430943648287
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities	146.28666323332337
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object	30.835452934962603
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her	103.82413536041405
Mr	1.0
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	91.48287198790304
Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red	487.03106937336094
Mr	1.0
Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr	86.18882802176181
Darcy just deigned to return	41.707053888653164
What could be the meaning of it	31.76671295955914
--It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know	52.73999799481933
In another minute Mr	119.29614756227016
Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend	139.89493461601268
Mr	1.0
Denny and Mr	24.272274177969397
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr	52.12176245482946
Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs	114.42523502717722
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation	120.1198323230379
Mrs	1.0
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr	146.90079473648973
Jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr	136.94531081960633
Collins by Jane's introduction of him	119.42520021805267
She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice	149.32750163317786
Mrs	1.0
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr	198.10642619328144
Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire	64.54614880890634
She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr	120.6252037384281
Wickham
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows	206.33201899688808
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr	71.75952440850122
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening	84.62438887520713
This was agreed to, and Mrs	49.15422302442123
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	135.32669664520972
The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits	144.55261919716827
Mr	1.0
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	108.52039330577698
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister	149.19042843889048
Mr	1.0
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs	86.32474315606504
Bennet by admiring Mrs	97.27519496006813
Philips's manners and politeness	193.90889600681967
He protested that except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before	109.11018952511292
Something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life	73.4954108615531
CHAPTER XVI	39.85745414057073
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr	149.7007236076062
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr	118.2652842632232
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr	155.21096500606038
Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house	125.456438513153
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr	137.27023537655373
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs	97.72139880114933
Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room	108.82037560223978
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs	71.45581288355284
Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could	102.98761467283218
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long	125.9324651472756
It was over at last however	56.226933998831214
The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr	158.9147334706618
Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	98.90150170845028
The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr	146.62679700529765
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room	109.55005176993765
Mr	1.0
Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker	146.55931010040982
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr	50.194310264805196
Wickham and the
officers, Mr	48.355859353153186
Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in Mrs	211.43091652007251
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	109.55483406558331
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist	113.10079101226793
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs	158.7037541633449
Philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason	148.12451423868634
Mr	1.0
Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia	236.2546175292576
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular	99.3928113338652
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr	37.46346685034104
Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr	67.40217431429907
Darcy	1.0
She dared not
even mention that gentleman	73.72907018485073
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved	256.10529490919026
Mr	1.0
Wickham began the subject himself	63.91082228757624
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr	173.85665475425537
Darcy had been staying there	26.638517573547887
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand	131.0134222366399
"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one	98.5372748062108
A clear ten
thousand per annum	24.19564509819652
You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	111.19822928018124
Elizabeth could not but look surprised	55.38139462153792
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday	175.70882402843336
--Are you much acquainted with Mr	57.27079874633343
Darcy	1.0
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable	91.62752178834306
"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise	85.4370083746381
I am not qualified to form one	71.85264045642182
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge	95.599621572367
It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial	45.41984023373474
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else	121.68876690441671
--Here you are in your own family	84.68809728547325
"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield	168.69473625697196
He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire	49.32707506841458
Every body is disgusted with his pride	53.46759217334546
You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one	232.57634689125226
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen	103.06767819828555
The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	164.27594597906943
"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man	159.196435570851
Wickham only shook his head	180.6682397411144
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer	125.38350561800353
"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield	45.78835896350376
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	79.91111978169553
"Oh	1.0
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr	65.51199238734168
Darcy	1.0
If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go	111.03331686736114
We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is	89.36144865759965
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr	64.35115698007343
Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr	89.38265470837167
Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections	111.68877394551822
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father	110.68807566966917
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	230.20383739429292
Mr	1.0
Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry	137.97608508811356
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire	90.27835399520508
I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them	242.37347399710026
Society, I own, is necessary to me	62.23607670962795
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude	154.62849020146928
I _must_ have employment and society	85.38133670205481
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible	223.14473138807406
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now	107.99116560657903
"Indeed	1.0
"Yes--the late Mr	30.01444803049904
Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift	135.53236035600835
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me	45.23205958542952
I cannot do justice to his kindness	58.20141202363027
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere	119.99628867160476
"Good heavens	37.28442647956627
cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be	79.8834892249817
--How could
his will be disregarded	49.3561173561723
--Why did not you seek legal redress	49.50684195469101
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law	40.200383825574946
A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr	83.21308579724216
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing	150.38878903153352
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it	113.60448655425299
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely	104.72796842403638
I can recal nothing worse	168.399595942627
But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me	73.57160676162488
"This is quite shocking	300.61145562039536
--He deserves to be publicly disgraced	55.06672236170352
"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_	40.43883146295859
Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_	102.49908340734083
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them	98.10876563393008
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive	131.19760648310017
--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly	89.39050928106462
"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy	214.63672224532286
Had the late Mr	58.24149593933198
Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life	177.72176873027396
He had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me	136.932888668339
"I had not thought Mr	31.79506068105522
Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this	135.4840645242239
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper	92.3462416546082
His disposition must
be dreadful	49.64995625804868
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him	92.0793648920544
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father	169.0203402383741
--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner	170.13393572548935
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care	102.3648579098159
_My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr	448.01011773579825
Philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late Mr	98.6075318889836
Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property	103.72749185557123
He was most highly esteemed by Mr	77.27886485355764
Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend	52.958434648765106
Mr	1.0
Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr	205.8755885109234
Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself	119.02038844517254
"How strange	9.77987743317904
cried Elizabeth	2.634894999603702
"How abominable	38.52245811690956
--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr	80.64766601371221
Darcy has not made him just to you	72.51797044743641
--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it	62.53570045782565
"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend	121.33339990115259
It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	145.94204575774944
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride	110.3666000471636
"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good	444.7305529800841
"Yes	1.0
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor	132.15257746413377
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this	200.6001750221241
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive	101.4374098529091
He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers	202.81592102940616
"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy	37.24346077843223
He shook his head	66.20526264733974
--"I wish I could call her amiable	149.21034360356137
It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy	81.45869673800264
But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud	49.127645954500274
--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement	109.46753529153752
But she is nothing to me now	44.61802328502696
She is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished	150.49849178110338
Since her
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education	242.14797436323792
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr	87.02699673761101
Bingley	1.0
How can Mr	21.67135450808844
Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man	195.6182442808597
How can they suit each other	60.89900481974954
--Do you
know Mr	22.72517047657951
Bingley	1.0
"Not at all	10.08920821509302
"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man	106.61401629508897
He cannot know what Mr	35.765066529208035
Darcy is	11.26380229670519
"Probably not;--but Mr	31.024945565972978
Darcy can please where he chuses	264.73625289017974
He does not
want abilities	39.97122392355417
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while	147.9483935072783
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	80.61026338266724
His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure	211.07604800555524
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr	88.74800378719625
Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs	62.9354663155554
Philips	1.0
--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter	96.53531705029201
It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs	114.8316834260274
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy	197.9150860874476
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	134.87840182341856
There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters	114.3570029726122
Mr	1.0
Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr	142.9313789405236
Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh	67.0429776989618
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living	42.157871334756734
I hardly know how Mr	34.77158361065299
Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long	128.10536053252676
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr	80.76228580895993
Darcy	1.0
"No, indeed, I did not	22.217403586691564
--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections	57.08465058545746
I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday	132.47113627218405
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	85.93149489294612
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley	85.65949411951931
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another	135.31967064523388
"Mr	1.0
Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman	128.0990091941485
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	95.63672445503776
She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class	139.67904351514787
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr	118.94208800615552
Wickham's attentions	8.25857882393092
There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs	75.56165187616158
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body	121.7313409464448
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully	189.05730113746262
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him	49.5050063713285
She could
think of nothing but of Mr	40.1603366533362
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr	122.72070752676645
Collins were once silent	352.6087508878517
Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr	74.58780059080273
Collins, in describing the civility of Mr	139.07350327215622
and
Mrs	12.460728037775995
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House	108.06723716210466
CHAPTER XVII	36.78408853961752
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr	47.89403640567253
Wickham and herself	20.996465242464193
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr	67.89987663448026
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr	79.02887473183367
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham	114.55493238964678
--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained	120.5568552071758
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea	135.30401637775236
Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other	668.8839758229386
It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side	108.44671312402058
"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business	130.41902953206412
--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody	76.8412502171239
"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion	72.76484812162147
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr	162.9336341898374
Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for	58.10973446291336
--It is
impossible	14.012253668417536
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it	95.08429988680612
Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him	129.6324176218966
oh	1.0
no	1.0
"I can much more easily believe Mr	50.30540199682592
Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr	158.47469196032836
Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony	90.1419413483261
--If it
be not so, let Mr	100.96465107015796
Darcy contradict it	66.64226872827099
Besides, there was truth in his
looks	95.36141593621113
"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing	50.708173240623836
--One does not know what to
think	32.80140830963038
"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think	95.63828997919678
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr	130.32912511520067
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public	124.03079529231503
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr	112.81081757281854
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday	171.65334336794515
The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation	212.0080414069039
To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs	188.5273431744445
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others	56.255497366779174
They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs	197.26457725190875
Bennet's civilities	15.89056503186228
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family	117.87322448356407
Mrs	1.0
Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr	98.41980097504587
Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card	83.0504989521406
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr	92.48079454035789
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr	51.35045493179853
Darcy's
looks and behaviour	68.8571655240955
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr	375.2044003639973
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball	219.34585208212255
And even Mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it	85.03692850520177
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough	93.46878251991748
--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	128.48974108663248
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body	224.51969555385
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr	70.18281129592413
Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr	93.05248850262736
Bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance	90.2705471213646
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her	122.05492828618031
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	40.04723986665623
She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr	143.55082151062962
Collins
instead	55.04188444501036
her liveliness had been never worse timed	164.93817388358534
There was no help
for it however	61.5624777781338
Mr	1.0
Wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and Mr	66.57130367831807
Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could	67.2759125934495
She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more	82.49069550967323
--It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors	157.81972597267833
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_	151.31430214777942
Elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply	206.85347725258035
Mr	1.0
Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him	121.6088327510746
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once	96.78877444523577
No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy	221.19841397207992
Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr	301.38849395195007
Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia	128.38117480255804
CHAPTER XVIII	34.82033085670652
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr	87.37815984789354
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	159.63236584902128
The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her	145.63815945392474
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening	89.49961914101041
But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr	169.71421047659905
Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr	111.68158448785532
Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	119.9620583409586
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make	164.6134348956674
--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham	230.61982011973026
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr	81.49224962394744
Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her	218.3465614915668
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice	86.5600046372399
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification	349.3094048962843
Mr	1.0
Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give	132.30113069222847
The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy	167.75724404425634
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked	162.27150489798714
When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr	208.1920352013389
Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him	106.22501246514236
He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her	143.26965319435288
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable	84.50930079064047
"Heaven forbid	7.703227592498684
--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all	53.47692127598295
--To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate	140.87067269493602
--Do not wish me
such an evil	62.76301941335763
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	153.8244636039415
Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr	124.21918437136199
Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it	279.17266563881896
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance	145.22327674879065
He replied, and was again silent	117.1268047013468
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr	117.66390811605746
Darcy	1.0
--_I_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples	61.897316236500274
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said	67.64592931538341
"Very well	6.732970802418319
--That reply will do for the present	52.78452611006567
--Perhaps by and bye I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones	222.44389668982134
--But _now_ we may be silent	36.19281272348155
"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing	170.7828542332683
"Sometimes	1.0
One must speak a little, you know	94.27334028558663
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible	103.15518958156848
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine	104.05393294473123
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds	90.20485109323297
--We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	78.32551695069326
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
said he	47.048311316252196
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say	58.68446030351898
--_You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	104.02033765143742
"I must not decide on my own performance	100.71762516137531
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton	82.85936187543497
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance	144.93031767941864
The effect was immediate	179.75608714664975
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on	300.1272047372549
At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"Mr	65.35005723577557
Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain	231.37251448769754
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life	60.19868905327454
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject	52.04172570461596
At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr	115.3956782949228
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner	301.19639670690873
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir	38.805338432907085
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen	89.63503186701494
It is evident that you belong to the
first circles	36.16295336391449
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place	221.98102653066064
What congratulations will
then flow in	97.78339553906082
I appeal to Mr	85.08294332523796
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir	285.2984546889222
--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	131.4743817281434
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together	242.22918302698372
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	144.59052475520429
"I do not think we were speaking at all	32.67598949462203
Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves	69.32939236544955
--We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine	193.14405362040912
"What think you of books	86.86314197286019
said he, smiling	45.30905511288092
"Books--Oh	1.0
no	1.0
--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings	37.67778256021727
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject	164.84922960058609
--We may compare our different opinions	68.49040378944656
"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else	78.84260729454672
"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it	56.77713017562775
said he,
with a look of doubt	85.04718107205571
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr	162.68975904949417
Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable	109.15339938085788
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_	72.93657740132195
"I am," said he, with a firm voice	132.95352972300557
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	184.46882170951383
"I hope not	35.687913688490816
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first	145.63932504514247
"May I ask to what these questions tend	223.6394858393935
"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity	193.69665357339633
"I am trying to make it out	28.000949834326008
"And what is your success	60.07331275387736
She shook her head	76.0840493404641
"I do not get on at all	44.89155648131729
I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	187.3956390105016
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either	145.25349487884915
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity	114.03170292519702
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied	176.6511529388344
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another	214.09176045293034
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham	320.0081134367583
--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
late Mr	121.04705198710595
Darcy's steward	13.57883524090735
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr	117.77414118787121
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr	144.0150895789946
Darcy in a most infamous manner	67.58725366740833
I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr	43.66292280066
Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way	104.13586641622122
His coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it	68.57615577760639
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better	152.7871369176654
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr	107.96669176234604
Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself	115.04932728824231
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer	114.50413448578762
"Excuse my interference	24.147899249436158
--It was kindly meant	35.391738978990624
"Insolent girl	54.874999283737864
said Elizabeth to herself	22.538389622633492
--"You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	131.05194915347312
I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr	123.20292402306974
Darcy	1.0
She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley	66.13141624598813
Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening	135.7683434250578
--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness	103.80888453019983
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr	120.24472228631342
Wickham	1.0
But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon	88.17200169250732
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you	77.35928541510314
Mr	1.0
Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr	122.95908308542586
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr	50.438739521745305
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr	228.8060989945656
Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, Mr	56.831138088768824
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man	114.89067194625436
I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr	51.45059432936558
Darcy's
regard	22.30026305013643
"Mr	1.0
Bingley does not know Mr	31.554815056599423
Wickham himself	36.28810574665005
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton	92.58761663421697
"This account then is what he has received from Mr	81.10002519280222
Darcy	1.0
I am
perfectly satisfied	9.633607500476527
But what does he say of the living	124.79745699600345
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr	76.36705152197277
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only	58.59300409630468
"I have not a doubt of Mr	24.550981913641206
Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	163.51724748888998
Mr	1.0
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before	146.67944482082981
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment	140.90332122482627
Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it	109.49688199779136
On their being joined by Mr	56.688730486041415
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr	183.94393212534732
Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery	76.52376946103601
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness	121.25021813304855
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine	127.9545765673563
How wonderfully these sort of things occur	134.89087670442103
Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly	47.19139409572913
--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before	98.37821878160963
My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	358.37689437003905
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr	46.198909825698266
Darcy	1.0
"Indeed I am	5.726463430070927
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	233.2871181079459
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_	39.25035271936841
It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night	50.11005009202051
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr	86.19861197563321
Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr	215.33314133502964
Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance	190.56278691686663
--Mr	1.0
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained	108.9189430926704
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty	121.28149319080599
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself	189.2460871343038
And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr	98.46489238885233
Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident	153.90762381230562
Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh	68.01430002088794
--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man	81.52587872154167
Mr	1.0
Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr	80.56888470042756
Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility	178.16687285837844
Mr	1.0
Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr	182.2055576273222
Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way	168.33135522216153
Mr	1.0
Collins then returned to Elizabeth	36.12413804269076
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception	82.03116750866266
Mr	1.0
Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	34.42764634383129
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	116.12587821646804
It was really a very
handsome thought	46.4562761993712
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him	24.16137648614967
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr	90.6717910775852
Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane	434.54271927666787
She saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters	317.0379020217634
Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much	147.04901542852716
When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
soon married to Mr	150.62593483804335
Bingley	1.0
--It was an animating subject, and Mrs	30.659143414038166
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match	65.65477935480286
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do	86.51717009179401
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	119.81784498576489
It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs	120.58781107546342
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	79.59712987460857
She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it	196.06911003445143
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr	101.62732534327084
Darcy, who sat opposite to them	623.462407842142
Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	88.8625609722921
"What is Mr	26.8766120436847
Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him	41.37167815616425
I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear	73.70259914037297
"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower	98.87675365844068
--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr	151.40181963534636
Darcy	1.0
--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing	75.77928438255283
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence	62.790193567559086
Her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	77.83789137182326
Elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation	152.3247247202316
She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr	71.75062179506247
Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	75.51585097449774
The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity	246.50778008156306
At length however Mrs	34.10513548967869
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	86.20615022487029
Elizabeth now began to revive	22.006189235117674
But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company	249.04418488168872
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song	126.45966128461697
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another	148.84391050717446
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected	207.1877560722917
--Elizabeth was in agonies	8.662088169022388
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley	62.62035335917546
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave	119.33433500731313
She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night	159.9650916048766
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child	105.18522904965138
You have delighted us long enough	105.53673444613693
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	43.95707996380158
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good	189.72213584911444
--Others of the party were now applied to	26.130709192246815
"If I," said Mr	35.95842477665946
Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman	105.53291712667753
--I do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to	100.50306831239186
The
rector of a parish has much to do	156.31141964368982
--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron	71.88502660801763
He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible	138.66477366708588
And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	135.9499036401032
I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family	83.45948000101583
And with a bow to Mr	75.23092308925145
Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	123.98406562719387
--Many
stared	26.644754250694085
--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr	117.30022295610642
Bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr	211.22594809952554
Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man	80.67272035525106
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed	121.14306394805799
That his two sisters and Mr	54.862644983257276
Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable	115.35967157841313
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement	121.7226430774514
She was teazed by
Mr	41.038159431760796
Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others	67.2008826134324
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	106.46555006850518
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening	174.10216806353156
There was no arguing upon such a project	26.12060837667001
She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr	119.12343001765663
Collins's conversation to herself	60.26612678674317
She was at least free from the offence of Mr	81.81119311934887
Darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak	187.50918999730033
She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr	50.8771819057466
Wickham, and rejoiced in
it	28.264777946206248
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of Mrs	103.62525162250284
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family	139.67860530501443
Mrs	1.0
Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	143.71399078806357
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs	74.61611429436702
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr	120.11656014188421
Collins, who was complimenting Mr	24.83065885538981
Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	134.23465679048812
Darcy said
nothing at all	56.98334996806182
Mr	1.0
Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene	248.2137077155383
Mr	1.0
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other	88.15330368481281
Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs	201.2143882571015
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am	103.43570504380405
accompanied by a violent yawn	21.395863638186196
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs	63.43092017134792
Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr	107.45144244799992
Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation	149.41652144524699
Bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time	93.86201854560456
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
months	197.19877057057934
Of having another daughter married to Mr	82.01711110882651
Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure	333.28930509103975
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr	109.66137293385275
Bingley and Netherfield	39.28833949078811
CHAPTER XIX	30.209671984467978
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn	83.52838274959801
Mr	1.0
Collins made his
declaration in form	139.33538323526147
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	146.06605016410933
On finding
Mrs	80.59013893920122
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning	151.45698818003467
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs	58.80926538146849
Bennet instantly answered,

"Oh dear	318.52982153294647
--Yes--certainly	1.0
--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection	36.390125083761696
--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs	151.8769775289359
And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,

"Dear Ma'am, do not go	213.82114591920077
--I beg you will not go	38.99123946101953
--Mr	1.0
Collins must excuse
me	86.5399332549581
--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	53.539661138552745
I am
going away myself	32.14493467411476
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy	339.2684121368659
--I desire you will stay where you are	77.15008789443887
--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr	521.8137699789402
Collins	1.0
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion	131.76029592043736
Mrs	1.0
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr	39.550310137322185
Collins began	15.536717566147075
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections	149.03477690391622
You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address	196.07628060488332
You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	111.0670235222329
Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life	149.94219483848377
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did	104.41653867973086
The idea of Mr	25.749991155574854
Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish	193.63417333658057
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness	92.81113295939585
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too	109.39390347696808
on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs	208.84223076876785
Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr	45.305744640030916
Collins, you
must marry	85.94823960165226
A clergyman like you must marry	470.10914986046157
--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way	215.1958874370709
This is my advice	46.39923211048231
Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her	76.52444730157833
Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer	67.06777768997003
You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite	158.63649535669057
Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women	153.31523780213075
But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years	174.69329316347267
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	136.99944796609998
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection	110.0309974113434
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents	133.52358250906454
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to	101.22683743787323
On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	168.49901001709136
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	49.5368775096141
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried	97.1591743583035
"You forget that I have made no
answer	38.92403833172401
Let me do it without farther loss of time	79.86500990371972
Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me	188.7285451270279
I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them	49.48285549396807
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr	60.60997682905455
Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time	158.59762844162796
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	120.66203664466141
"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration	396.535334022281
I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time	119.11638898874044
I am perfectly serious in my refusal	52.28294906184487
--You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so	60.17320301038432
--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation	154.9273114159588
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr	72.2785385025915
Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you	50.705072107423476
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications	55.43169575909796
"Indeed, Mr	9.732778406059325
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary	171.83819859011325
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say	149.93843591062497
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	156.965573999023
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach	146.6993539698633
This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled	131.6192195661317
And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr	72.1203710785177
Collins thus
addressed her,

"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character	146.200977511049
"Really, Mr	41.17019499057601
Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly	233.40917339765932
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one	134.98799247207603
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	194.90878290165935
My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable	153.2494702120771
My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	139.34462558750133
Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	170.56033495393226
As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females	228.11306386649693
"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	83.26841679108419
I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	137.62420537025992
I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible	100.38370677732942
My feelings in every respect
forbid it	101.31626042640612
Can I speak plainer	42.908024729423694
Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart	114.48448624728466
"You are uniformly charming	246.79650676605903
cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable	267.30024489876905
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	173.25049531130912
CHAPTER XX	4.382152576585008
Mr	1.0
Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs	252.58865710262086
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	173.5758154841571
Mr	1.0
Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	173.83038852452705
This information, however, startled Mrs	112.03378453643683
Bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so	91.12274679697934
"But depend upon it, Mr	52.29916112455502
Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason	185.23251182078127
I will speak to her about it myself directly	207.3481521951378
She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it	114.06745574203958
"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr	120.80042584255787
Collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	160.7984687798352
If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity	249.96757038762854
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs	341.7698627192678
Bennet, alarmed	18.48121459468615
"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these	557.3147661362437
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived	118.67566749257699
I will go directly to Mr	33.02954350878574
Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure	50.18218573121372
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh	108.43827897251676
Mr	1.0
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar	60.2751692536663
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr	127.33267542230114
Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_	53.264801252609196
Mr	1.0
Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication	177.5671253705865
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech	83.14146964473528
"Of what are you talking	56.25829421793162
"Of Mr	12.68105899963048
Collins and Lizzy	32.609807904040174
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr	43.13302019306723
Collins,
and Mr	17.558418395360864
Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy	42.57492794084036
"And what am I to do on the occasion	94.73245361491942
--It seems an hopeless business	226.8180463331325
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself	133.41878616004638
Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him	75.91248541521188
"Let her be called down	86.8737000561119
She shall hear my opinion	75.48194130013353
Mrs	1.0
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library	55.50440463337084
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared	67.27972225806545
"I have sent for
you on an affair of importance	95.24598064231462
I understand that Mr	46.483486639118226
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage	59.89877493879722
Is it true	68.9908202855331
Elizabeth replied that it was	22.010620883060724
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused	129.04844997253858
"I have, Sir	28.002594234617856
"Very well	6.732970802418319
We now come to the point	31.582512868557814
Your mother insists upon your
accepting it	127.63906727532043
Is not it so, Mrs	104.33434934405062
Bennet	1.0
"Yes, or I will never see her again	82.85938375540665
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth	126.58331115739973
From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents	58.26350863028625
--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr	72.7740420395808
Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_	45.100387056875405
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs	50.741389339971
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed	92.07995142786507
"What do you mean, Mr	34.53964054977905
Bennet, by talking in this way	55.66343785606778
You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him	161.20208155211387
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request	70.40494591401327
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room	110.74767943602082
I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be	38.01046964439556
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs	63.124528229616985
Bennet give up the point	38.27966583245426
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns	59.5839727561188
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	238.48572075753003
Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did	537.7146425813319
Mr	1.0
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed	155.29293844770476
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way	159.62051204593104
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret	247.43394240057802
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them	132.9638900100002
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here	142.95392294108663
--What do you think has happened this morning	48.00696982059898
--Mr	1.0
Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him	61.87177801733685
Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs	100.01284200854424
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family	93.06840699361052
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves	216.61896293081048
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth	83.65016473473514
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs	171.49493059079055
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way	133.60954844467472
--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead	119.89496422202811
--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you	47.52103259682277
--I have done with you from this very day	58.89969812265052
--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word	85.90046411954214
I have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children	45.76448720252393
--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body	85.36522129667854
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking	163.46600825706852
Nobody can tell what I
suffer	55.56413147778453
--But it is always so	22.96709917767547
Those who do not complain are never
pitied	67.37117465308302
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	196.12969768249727
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr	89.0340938587206
Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr	116.27084597221597
Collins and me have a little conversation together	145.91415247984455
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr	141.54571907581294
Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear	182.59215634482211
In a doleful voice Mrs	59.77401585851866
Bennet thus began the projected
conversation	76.9058188033306
--"Oh	1.0
Mr	1.0
Collins	1.0
--

"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point	70.44311441946498
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter	152.19601049652601
Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
trust I am resigned	93.29213441896071
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	218.57426931888412
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr	128.6616462313749
Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	97.05476775708512
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own	193.77778641915762
But we are all liable to
error	64.36140276771391
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair	201.66349015283987
My object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise	151.6172216676817
CHAPTER XXI	4.382152576585008
The discussion of Mr	89.7293463213457
Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	141.66936293446523
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence	223.1055253562631
He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend	82.56468314589564
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs	72.99470252808916
Bennet's ill humour or ill
health	201.0573454526558
Mr	1.0
Collins was also in the same state of angry pride	75.14120304049433
Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it	86.25556487000101
He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay	82.14026556556334
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr	275.99814615529357
Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball	224.7562632408312
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over	171.85196202095514
--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed	110.05848408271815
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr	117.21321843219638
Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself	82.74141594074875
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her	144.26799629057226
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	104.50957487236452
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately	173.41605445669703
The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	188.59689977415826
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs	198.49945334531068
When they
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,

"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal	158.79529235939012
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again	125.80289094680921
You shall hear what she says	55.3490152708149
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr	170.09612056565845
Hurst had a house	40.87971942461957
The next was in these words	109.88317714499182
"I do not pretend to
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence	234.37993622715445
I depend on you for that	56.71914238100881
To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr	181.851486315791
Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his	93.97028492821454
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country	88.91229177372313
But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters	470.2958253402168
--Mr	1.0
Bingley will not be detained in London by
them	82.96429739486796
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter	79.56716387749579
I will read it to you--

"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel	123.27317753032587
Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair	91.73365444016385
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you	159.2493730276446
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter	179.8009118104104
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_	182.92771165018078
"Why will you think so	49.11491393637375
It must be his own doing	69.30713481573746
--He is his own master	98.66660264800113
But you do not know _all_	14.662555613089546
I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me	134.91640286153162
I will have no reserves from _you_	33.76229439787757
"Mr	1.0
Darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again	93.00289718359927
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister	189.67780646855076
I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable	98.46066758107774
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart	185.05558352892479
With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many	171.58115266697158
"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy	38.334228015919294
--said Jane as she
finished it	38.207959737208824
"Is it not clear enough	203.75700028948154
--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly	115.69093027755467
to
put me on my guard	139.08084456390415
Can there be any other opinion on the subject	114.2004407322842
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different	154.24460746004578
--Will you hear it	91.95037763499454
"Most willingly	24.776478137507997
"You shall have it in few words	114.15693693596087
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy	73.28331913459365
She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you	70.5347635630702
Jane shook her head	43.40746666607979
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me	37.053234249852494
--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection	124.9693480452705
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot	18.153764979881547
She is
not such a simpleton	52.85725500955077
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr	102.7286285778002
Darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes	111.24027721687523
But the case is
this	46.686390297156116
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way	107.8275123138415
But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend	119.39379265391518
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy	91.42887367412742
But I know the
foundation is unjust	30.868486326644486
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself	109.75938756969052
"That is right	15.26467047416685
--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine	76.26928346193336
Believe her to be deceived by all means	42.40873704641968
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer	210.66681869817594
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere	224.0903358656132
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him	92.58250847257968
"How can you talk so	61.50983350458833
--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate	108.50621768254096
"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion	76.05312548477904
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required	250.4627358166071
A thousand things may arise in six months	172.85712108728248
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt	110.51804287306109
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one	130.73230280999468
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	90.33938846102532
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	141.85764005451983
They agreed that Mrs	92.7058261524131
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together	167.9867374663878
After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr	122.7726302139034
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses	93.49069689697201
CHAPTER XXII	4.382152576585008
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr	91.99659827514975
Collins	1.0
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	35.38349358158491
"It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express	56.00807480068804
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	123.39896792895094
This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of Mr	140.4991614024479
Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself	176.72096982657456
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon	181.05305395368774
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet	96.94396047235306
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday	169.27225797527535
His
reception however was of the most flattering kind	273.5526409228473
Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	75.33323419485994
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	67.71438595793761
In as short a time as Mr	125.76359105379709
Collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness	124.4386687498312
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained	232.61135706334932
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	93.65450913229022
Mr	1.0
Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair	218.85668555110544
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr	144.29979193942472
Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr	115.08645441717397
Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St	89.69611950326724
James's	1.0
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion	95.7219227745866
The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid	281.3829603521004
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed	96.90533170729383
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it	86.6512982001303
Her reflections were
in general satisfactory	201.9977946265043
Mr	1.0
Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary	178.5321242096422
But still he would be her husband	44.29162544934098
--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want	260.6681131512151
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it	134.7449097693835
The least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person	200.37265017952194
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation	151.07862724345776
She resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged Mr	78.06902344776088
Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	88.49310233326844
A promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	118.32040158400032
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs	114.79236325870092
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them	119.13808432147874
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible	53.65136797121876
They were all astonished; and Mr	26.498872995480593
Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir	225.67457353598564
--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness	243.772640796369
"My dear sir," replied Mr	17.075890009117487
Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence	74.23780445083938
"You cannot be too much on your guard	61.60343037907258
Risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence	115.68602987456651
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire	118.40075403676056
As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth	136.42673851329855
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	305.5054771470568
Mrs	1.0
Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	65.0851610584002
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion	169.55728530856945
But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away	94.05695327459499
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before	107.49690694246935
The possibility of Mr	23.920020666161072
Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"Engaged to Mr	109.78340421988031
Collins	1.0
my dear Charlotte,--impossible	3.207083631063131
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza	187.2871184659407
--Do you think it incredible
that Mr	47.410500214665056
Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	54.24176697233172
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness	78.2296099197482
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr	172.64814986695572
Collins was wishing to
marry you	77.6608796395063
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done	41.37609354586492
I am not romantic you know	14.613166716407125
I
never was	35.28055924107582
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr	170.752236845885
Collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state	185.4076218613575
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family	96.40523725479407
Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	79.0208077749602
It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match	52.39173712355216
The strangeness of Mr	15.602972086402014
Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted	102.31630893086526
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage	128.37218531747786
Charlotte the wife of Mr	122.51528634254419
Collins,
was a most humiliating picture	48.975729086293704
--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen	111.30776407879655
CHAPTER XXIII	4.382152576585008
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family	100.11507781776885
With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs	194.35848989409953
Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"Good Lord	421.8294785177252
Sir William, how can you tell such a story	53.97635657304326
--Do not you know
that Mr	20.343985913589993
Collins wants to marry Lizzy	99.11545175326593
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy	124.09047215132588
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr	114.1545435265063
Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London	76.3610954725343
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent	98.03038089634059
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr	47.452689666312985
Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off	56.61425187050079
Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	102.40634173120868
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her	51.216780194530656
--Nor did that day wear out her
resentment	155.11942676064854
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter	131.49024285634167
Mr	1.0
Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter	162.26694827848502
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	135.02054381402812
Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr	78.94395775558603
Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton	130.52911759413314
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs	55.75197759069733
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs	115.97376234082016
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away	166.1788451118122
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again	100.13660909243595
Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return	190.23699655849148
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	111.45755324284434
The promised
letter of thanks from Mr	173.9904296608599
Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted	114.19033779397095
After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men	154.44615240729468
Mr	1.0
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs	68.41879335998324
Bennet	1.0
On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband	39.84972114643145
--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome	58.221125797935564
--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable	182.61092645218437
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs	130.4559703911426
Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr	79.48005798073136
Bingley's continued
absence	1472.64807528003
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	211.15797830651903
Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs	135.1474427559604
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood	90.24661499238937
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	80.64888092097742
Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring	81.84110968430822
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment	121.58564643058723
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to	109.92054213605023
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used	156.60464728979582
It needed all
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity	908.6097322431923
Mr	1.0
Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction	175.9777869574626
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company	148.33706048228262
The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	100.15502908758954
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state	50.25455331687978
The very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	94.71991874920863
The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her	56.832874967372426
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence	156.12469527978968
Whenever Charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr	107.9108501252302
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr	65.69428171655424
Bennet were dead	55.48196360129175
She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband	50.105573712605
"Indeed, Mr	9.732778406059325
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it	79.5662651289456
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	76.63815921523457
Let us hope for
better things	83.51466811109488
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor	22.11636079388586
This was not very consoling to Mrs	53.2601701309735
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	74.57788391827381
If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it	63.2749186257244
"What should not you mind	71.83993857320205
"I should not mind any thing at all	39.0801848606352
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility	115.04548365982204
"I never can be thankful, Mr	59.25198606384666
Bennet, for any thing about the entail	37.89315076406078
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr	227.17546439984508
Collins too	11.745645633848163
--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else	86.95104720693608
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr	132.2745551775902
Bennet	1.0

PRIDE & PREJUDICE	3.3110901982898118
CHAPTER I	4.88293655229344
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt	44.128120885876825
The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country	126.81207145760358
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort	93.72616022108578
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it	91.88645855306855
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter	124.70567270509788
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr	64.83442896690258
Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture	242.4197444894932
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation	127.13507792171208
Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others	107.00577082560841
To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit	126.01402845895743
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations	152.1898577273511
Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself	252.63509758674377
It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing	110.1228688943125
She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded	166.52614052916914
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs	77.3635677479139
Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh	168.88287128396817
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	150.49431914639518
But I
will not repine	54.95343007633084
It cannot last long	106.46805065010419
He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before	68.6556543777363
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing	63.344137554579824
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason	202.09018043915754
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all	61.217011004687805
I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with	116.15547948064511
Thank God	12.446362953374306
I have not _that_ pain	53.68453877546714
A
little time therefore	27.468273099180685
--I shall certainly try to get the better	128.90842161426124
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself	107.19177753113087
"My dear Jane	5.622251607499611
exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good	82.4176971837564
Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you	38.69574427342053
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve	91.41973410051666
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection	101.6247272836748
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair	67.25268820598298
_You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body	117.8893545362248
_I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it	303.5418184258364
Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will	89.51682177228942
You need not	14.226551848180996
There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well	92.53142208452358
The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense	123.65279986369524
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte's marriage	123.30786956151807
It is unaccountable	25.656602318514654
in every view it
is unaccountable	140.49618939954016
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these	24.47809077131603
They will
ruin your happiness	70.72551987240966
You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper	100.73982020208736
Consider Mr	5.759992061295709
Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character	120.29113235430253
Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin	140.64659051886676
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding, than I now do of her heart	158.5335168382924
My dear Jane, Mr	21.509684718973478
Collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking	75.47517921516666
You shall not defend her,
though it is Charlotte Lucas	126.83208150254745
You shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness	181.22818544341732
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together	124.09383503055733
But enough of this	29.573846102970677
You alluded to something else	78.92234327736425
You
mentioned _two_ instances	124.11173394742947
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk	144.66495640799377
We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured	581.1447459751714
We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect	44.07958083174187
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us	107.95173739902063
Women fancy admiration means more than
it does	110.81453279272029
"And men take care that they should	105.9467330360121
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	124.29565283490105
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr	23.203744420639705
Bingley's conduct to design,"
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery	116.87564536097557
Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business	119.04739730131601
"And do you impute it to either of those	48.678233568093354
"Yes; to the last	13.809089505969085
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem	89.37862968945987
Stop me whilst you can	46.18927814357611
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him	182.9824553533137
"Yes, in conjunction with his friend	20.208994643314107
"I cannot believe it	17.43958214039184
Why should they try to influence him	215.2096914059285
They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it	140.26225384766866
"Your first position is false	75.99018956114566
They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride	181.74563481193996
"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	245.2365128725259
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better	219.9141243413251
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's	134.20550918700602
What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable	213.60363849073562
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	137.91255124565902
By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy	114.18147711795396
Do not distress me by the idea	35.007353114407216
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	67.86012870781315
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood	114.39370084429417
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr	52.719244527498475
Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	45.02631148862953
Mrs	1.0
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity	214.656355046773
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day	89.09672397117386
Mrs	1.0
Bennet's best
comfort was, that Mr	135.11733312830228
Bingley must be down again in the summer	44.48283787137133
Mr	1.0
Bennet treated the matter differently	37.67904816985324
"So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love I find	163.9301555533159
I congratulate her	25.357950527630752
Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	99.5842672323733
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions	119.0660930582981
When is your turn to come	54.32965564636206
You will hardly bear to be
long outdone by Jane	41.23005782096262
Now is your time	81.72918695603524
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	78.72559726242989
Let Wickham
be _your_ man	268.81675794355584
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably	29.894094957749918
"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	147.86774094654226
We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune	147.1308700058463
"True," said Mr	19.45852260894804
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it	83.49027720586616
Mr	1.0
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family	144.4493630189729
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve	117.97191027233953
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr	71.16487345709106
Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr	81.6972029437404
Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter	50.92066512417506
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr	131.02599971614998
Darcy was condemned as the worst of men	133.0197490181652
CHAPTER II	30.593157938584177
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr	248.32600370695744
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday	127.71942812313104
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	167.1735051752871
He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks	191.6316578092484
On the following Monday, Mrs	80.88377441530618
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn	72.4781953734426
Mr	1.0
Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education	151.82436529139852
The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable	106.36159494237083
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner, who was several years younger than
Mrs	101.55716824591599
Bennet and Mrs	16.795833865166742
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces	95.72838236182312
Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard	142.6417852838538
They had frequently been staying with her in town	90.50880126220477
The first part of Mrs	43.98174581070863
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	176.33093845533938
When this was
done, she had a less active part to play	171.26962766514063
It became her turn to listen	58.167022496603366
Mrs	1.0
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of	81.23929734330252
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister	74.93052926291308
Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it	72.12610975129311
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr	54.4528936053771
Bingley, if she could	19.11667484839862
But, Lizzy	8.892832109202958
Oh, sister	28.341964885351484
it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr	29.011435484070265
Collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness	136.28950097673612
He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him	112.95311187444625
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever	88.93167875321228
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister	117.10819382814299
They are all for what they can get	48.2834701389604
I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is	53.24357461014774
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else	100.9814190983982
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves	77.35373201947766
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation	101.01763321776434
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject	142.58258742105457
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she	78.43570083853302
"I am
sorry it went off	27.183984861416455
But these things happen so often	246.6892545587296
A young man, such
as you describe Mr	105.40561043650166
Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	75.85150936068354
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_	58.31476769581437
We do not suffer by _accident_	176.36308999923392
It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before	75.77014370189536
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea	104.63796227112189
It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment	118.30112501404042
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr	222.73354073171157
Bingley's
love	23.138764810724265
"I never saw a more promising inclination	54.3683409405243
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her	126.76375689520594
Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable	91.24162149297095
At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer	160.54358064607192
Could there be
finer symptoms	229.3999481411266
Is not general incivility the very essence of love	110.84457343200471
"Oh, yes	4.891929890542565
--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt	70.78096004540969
Poor
Jane	7.954645169797391
I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately	132.46211977188975
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	99.05042263991739
But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us	40.62604119674843
Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything	154.1124008993458
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence	78.91597482135651
"I hope," added Mrs	160.8674297184516
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her	108.46152440589803
We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her	110.11702868975355
"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr	74.69336822146921
Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London	106.83273215160571
My dear aunt, how could you think of it	41.40138844396262
Mr	1.0
Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr	112.14856980594199
Bingley
never stirs without him	75.82788051493797
"So much the better	21.854594368625094
I hope they will not meet at all	51.34465102659613
But does not Jane
correspond with the sister	56.782914803184596
_She_ will not be able to help calling	27.509578560229684
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely	302.6990644118178
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless	115.96242796413942
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions	81.63613970586756
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him	106.27121165169255
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement	91.72087106154788
Mrs	1.0
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner	120.32691942461824
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr	208.6172068976414
Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs	115.14828193474065
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both	100.46220046966123
Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment	130.67622351083702
To Mrs	23.49011875024657
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers	527.5462405737156
About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged	162.66439363207158
They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring	126.58025471096434
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr	87.58109820095676
Darcy by
character perfectly well	102.81793487109827
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse	81.7555171866273
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself	123.40751829509321
On being made acquainted with the
present Mr	53.20200022569669
Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr	117.74712924544491
Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy	172.45282537139698
CHAPTER III	31.267591934088102
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly	161.87443915079513
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard	105.92143879155029
Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent	120.29141419432551
I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better	60.53107887828275
But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you	70.23530385901499
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it	78.00225578524787
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure	68.5173057975891
You must not disappoint your father	69.48284966679896
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed	120.6557541839281
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise	127.39407334965146
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm	155.7099248045412
I will take care of
myself, and of Mr	45.2618732649549
Wickham too	20.267604382353113
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it	43.64561425639929
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now	78.96462055314585
"I beg your pardon	115.36796960775902
I will try again	85.83464674104353
At present I am not in love with
Mr	37.69695724771414
Wickham; no, I certainly am not	125.53029181779169
But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not	89.0705382097663
I see the imprudence
of it	44.717049597809854
--Oh	1.0
_that_ abominable Mr	109.30244647556776
Darcy	1.0
--My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it	114.39592986151334
My
father, however, is partial to Mr	73.4670934488788
Wickham	1.0
In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist	128.77639416057843
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry	53.37270532692008
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object	115.61617419475914
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing	41.55058972525774
In short,
I will do my best	123.98815792293662
"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often	43.263226223915865
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him	138.8780515558989
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_	88.33581475758987
But do not imagine
that he is always here so often	71.18358801198455
It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week	64.71359504011357
You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends	77.48722748938631
But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you
are satisfied	152.26291711922093
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented	122.63644273532806
Mr	1.0
Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs	118.80956542787837
Bennet	1.0
His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy	126.9315818757683
Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room	116.13264181287916
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza	118.84115141335745
"_That_ you certainly shall	53.63129255129718
"And I have another favour to ask	64.84504019026255
Will you come and see me	120.26548576817929
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire	53.403074990209056
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time	27.38565888373975
Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford	54.153096814535864
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit	112.88776066886771
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and
I hope you will consent to be of the party	97.09190017987413
Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them	61.753427785638095
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual	114.12844610921947
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible	147.18575180686824
Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was	83.99693699134032
Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	113.66811917781564
She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise	101.23594251318605
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging	192.04268449722986
It was Mr	22.864814713760246
Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest	101.84041553780307
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys	96.57050799970825
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is	108.63352925374421
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline	136.079918542028
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost	206.74023529986584
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street	65.07848615071946
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley	60.5758448045351
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London	111.4647158474507
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her	146.5355918231845
I enquired after their brother, of course	125.47136909373823
He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr	50.0576095968167
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him	49.591369634595615
I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner	70.4374308853877
I wish I could see her	46.83979847631963
My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs	73.53990961714378
Hurst were going out	77.2380495016064
I dare say I shall
soon see them here	77.30010294891879
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter	117.24149356112137
It convinced her, that
accident only could discover to Mr	222.1393648757642
Bingley her sister's being in town	87.29389382638792
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him	45.38444967642984
She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention	84.74631242656565
After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer	112.08535394052042
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt	59.06452708386575
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me	59.33042586660055
But, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	188.6502314246099
I do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
     be deceived again	78.66746194415309
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time	232.7171601465141
When
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	104.43840065280149
I pity, though I
     cannot help blaming her	53.84246185651397
She was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side	77.22262169865851
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it	81.65014343066042
I need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable	200.37627608593928
I cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago	222.00169450696654
He knows of my
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy	102.45747927285224
I cannot
     understand it	27.889041083058274
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this	70.94457512529058
But I will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt	118.641311812665
Let me hear
     from you very soon	68.71756472817248
Miss Bingley said something of his never
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty	112.62262131537625
We had better not mention it	131.04327267585643
I am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     Hunsford	87.57106068746765
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria	66.1491972149991
I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there	26.63432276924004
"Your's, &c	1.042784185590511
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least	96.40513307223928
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	82.01518015721504
She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions	61.04402449779482
His character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr	120.57109414295293
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away	85.48717541951434
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself	193.49000353423165
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else	141.31750077606438
Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain	83.53101844061436
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it	180.51047537549206
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	103.1273935030318
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy	149.87178870698114
All this was acknowledged to Mrs	55.987009576515916
Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil	190.60798921778579
But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King	784.5646450401739
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl	69.7867168594672
There can be no love in all this	40.057846950270644
My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance	71.16699961486184
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	185.3663308172435
Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do	145.42029904719072
They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain	99.83113356603494
CHAPTER IV	47.15195378156759
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away	219.63146527768768
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford	63.84516855455341
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty	173.04870353545093
Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr	125.81813735751957
Collins	1.0
There was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake	128.2571944930419
The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay	81.03956251453522
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch	57.40076623704153
She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter	60.638088149809555
The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be	253.55441437196777
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter	227.91636141744468
The farewell between herself and Mr	117.2436286605955
Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more	154.95023817373982
His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing	162.09658675379646
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable	79.41293428184535
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise	116.50903186031634
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known Sir William's too long	81.14774459399709
He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information	297.5848698924955
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon	106.01307880393549
As they drove to Mr	32.88598055926043
Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever	134.4595865451441
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower	160.75005027231248
All was joy and
kindness	93.84562868580984
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres	63.66816761925581
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	55.71746822757867
Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection	112.06830647325246
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long	59.59930945700465
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance	128.8317448336374
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well	193.00300216191985
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King	76.74060713387365
I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	110.15948336224677
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive	137.34735627528255
Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin	131.4679286982831
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary	103.06392566359148
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think	116.29268026485197
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe	44.46659583796798
I know no harm of her	36.00464951363009
"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune	100.85179255716719
"No--why should he	110.95887194651229
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor	117.9058068243976
"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event	132.11152934483047
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe	166.4868089492705
If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_	89.11427441175742
"_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_	179.20465533113975
It only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling	153.03853100750484
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose	59.739859899568536
_He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish	79.2837661688646
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose	38.12633338565055
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire	70.96045353619365
"Oh	1.0
if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better	152.99632426381973
I am sick of them all	15.853766759306287
Thank Heaven	2.0153399676166845
I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him	286.91531215785267
Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all	591.5056721370854
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment	255.20147097764158
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	80.65365955696305
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs	153.49557312276175
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes	47.281609246309316
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	98.357900830568
"My dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight	104.63483051606522
what felicity	49.97283798421264
You give me
fresh life and vigour	53.86636352934201
Adieu to disappointment and spleen	27.22657238805663
What are men
to rocks and mountains	125.49196215065791
Oh	1.0
what hours of transport we shall spend	68.24007355690317
And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing	69.9824194909979
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen	61.51280024003408
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation	128.79985564752485
Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	211.2632584340246
CHAPTER V	44.91202906605083
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	136.83122088761093
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view	137.65613330553094
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side	204.62920960279882
Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	66.85149357233502
At length the Parsonage was discernible	48.79637141756808
The garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving	81.62992889343893
Mr	1.0
Collins and Charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party	49.52885012035038
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other	37.98062602266283
Mrs	1.0
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received	125.56687144783011
She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	200.55888875656316
They were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment	97.50059448284479
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	113.94711808093084
But though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion	102.22774511038249
When Mr	7.590193850603917
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte	200.48729217934235
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear	174.92597257907457
After sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
Mr	71.84115926713987
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	94.42115217513751
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible	119.25074149170565
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind	223.64184888755773
He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	125.60956022892526
But
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house	165.3271863451331
It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground	362.4371658009968
From his garden, Mr	60.17555426634678
Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help	177.18202861999623
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit	171.50453041744782
When Mr	7.590193850603917
Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten	245.7907367101095
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country	34.33574892746686
It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr	81.84663019813348
Collins joining
in, observed,

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her	68.70850139288403
She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over	110.63523135884905
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here	151.38559689054526
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming	53.7043832576881
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home	145.23876496767613
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us	80.50758571274994
I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several	99.21661004316825
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour	202.99129080052276
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say	29.783395115556992
She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	124.12039823144244
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well	247.96602945933304
She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr	133.32922589969075
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings	248.68629980736551
A lively imagination soon settled it all	87.90631153349003
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her	115.56248012683095
She opened the
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"Oh, my dear Eliza	113.25608878843633
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen	35.70001331403371
I will not tell you what it is	30.099118120500172
Make
haste, and come down this moment	35.976258655800876
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate	124.9735242875426
"And is this all	109.50563650361
cried Elizabeth	2.634894999603702
"I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter	83.3925745420346
"La	1.0
my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady
Catherine	120.77395098305286
The old lady is Mrs	211.8302729173986
Jenkinson, who lives with them	109.45254905225094
The
other is Miss De Bourgh	25.565567048667116
Only look at her	59.63349528214977
She is quite a little
creature	119.27362210804357
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small	44.21694943406098
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind	57.53043746638898
Why does she not come in	107.4981019185754
"Oh	1.0
Charlotte says, she hardly ever does	105.98104272396938
It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in	72.42382973618105
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas	144.5328798265435
"She
looks sickly and cross	114.17644974681855
--Yes, she will do for him very well	41.579097872252014
She will
make him a very proper wife	65.58657075822438
Mr	1.0
Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh
looked that way	113.87269606867461
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house	67.74829164148413
Mr	1.0
Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day	105.21204370174445
CHAPTER VI	43.529276357152554
Mr	1.0
Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	70.93589836178734
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	119.97686641948528
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings	77.33121040592398
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen	117.2402762468201
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this	63.77095221208609
Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival	138.09111416721245
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire	143.48738688846103
About the Court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	663.6067121190775
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to Rosings	79.83195589238798
Mr	1.0
Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	107.04630465031701
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel	77.71873544584862
Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter	192.686603684771
I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more	80.69589559322154
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed	74.24862180593742
She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved	228.70101724196178
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	136.7274808301948
--Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at St	142.08032444418333
James's	1.0
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park	103.87818923734959
--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr	85.56904800578607
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh	122.30529218683864
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm	72.41452244959206
--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her	87.70606820841347
She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation	69.02855505257976
From the entrance hall, of which Mr	40.327217234415706
Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs	244.0637019594061
Jenkinson were sitting	15.231774767591016
--Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs	48.2269440421141
Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary	199.36337282018414
In spite of having been at St	34.19781751367205
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look	95.69330000063609
Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly	204.66683402054508
--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome	111.39295647913016
Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank	162.83764726408904
She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr	202.04306577439166
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
represented	65.55634015736071
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr	128.7804261722914
Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small	137.3062414445023
There was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies	255.91931338990852
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs	80.65715666625526
Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes	127.54317836670624
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, Mr	86.11616097478453
Collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer	120.96526996853257
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr	72.13801896792165
Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater	87.29848295120375
--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear	165.2329710361912
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them	159.67455822829396
The party did not supply much conversation	251.86646132244857
Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time	124.85150058835434
Mrs	1.0
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed	159.95308520821223
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	156.35479873589193
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted	105.94528273982793
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry	103.299029987482
Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others	118.95656832500035
In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs	55.46224920254249
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs	180.63343217968543
Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl	116.21943075125274
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name	103.38843468684053
--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly	106.59174460459539
--Lady Catherine then
observed,

"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr	138.6289180061053
Collins, I think	38.68601511544841
For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line	113.23114244741747
--It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family	73.13945617464931
--Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet	72.84081865405915
"A little	7.3092046434910625
"Oh	1.0
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you	66.30524298994064
Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day	199.8987108832879
--Do your sisters play and sing	100.39960978892147
"One of them does	69.47834614698624
"Why did not you all learn	37.48082656748125
--You ought all to have learned	60.662562910026345
The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's	167.29445522741753
--Do you draw	37.32273526896171
"No, not at all	20.758488589173567
"What, none of you	25.410605997472935
"Not one	17.82103096827274
"That is very strange	25.651579343012475
But I suppose you had no opportunity	36.06067206193981
Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	182.26148768683052
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London	68.46502504100445
"Has your governess left you	146.00840513246095
"We never had any governess	70.86795978641128
"No governess	93.304058517696
How was that possible	130.65991893744751
Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess	59.49735492443118
--I never heard of such a thing	32.85272995671355
Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education	91.35413936338298
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case	55.171453912630966
"Then, who taught you	156.03870550063832
who attended to you	26.612237920645494
Without a governess you must
have been neglected	58.6156346030528
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means	148.43820028912174
We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary	164.34491642220507
Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might	138.4053548876652
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one	131.63811173659283
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it	163.9446973557027
It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way	74.68417808139522
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out	82.11260467819677
Four nieces
of Mrs	22.754013778579527
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her	168.26566508204354
Mrs	1.0
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me	106.01698599035377
She finds Miss Pope a treasure	113.0903787707529
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure	58.75645604518848
Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet	73.4580542947598
"Yes, Ma'am, all	260.04540453911846
"All	1.0
--What, all five out at once	134.40322468028353
Very odd	23.590852619462336
--And you only the
second	86.09368553244906
--The younger ones out before the elder are married	173.65060494830098
--Your
younger sisters must be very young	53.46378635746154
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen	116.9721200224168
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company	116.16865585682002
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early	97.36793672229068
--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first	108.16324602693201
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive	46.92358027569458
--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind	56.42204500560572
"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person	130.9139655595357
--Pray, what is your age	57.12096283032985
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	210.8290202478619
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	109.04618081730777
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age	68.10795372271507
"I am not one and twenty	28.30827414405167
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed	74.31966659722093
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr	28.38503634380444
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs	68.78021806909265
Jenkinson to make up her
party	72.41363099816239
Their table was superlatively stupid	133.30120901301524
Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs	140.7593498932499
Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light	233.7586486243706
A great deal more passed at the
other table	50.7210755904379
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself	99.14021151558634
Mr	1.0
Collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many	162.43894535309505
Sir William did not say much	19.932544657625133
He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names	74.38361617933003
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs	99.27107127717738
Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered	79.87216450329933
The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow	93.27527319000646
From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr	86.04795590243896
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed	171.9310678696336
As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was	90.06800734313535
But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr	229.57314868404325
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's
praise into his own hands	69.33939618040348
CHAPTER VII	54.98634585633872
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with	101.5764153212163
While Sir William was with them, Mr	59.739621585333055
Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road	144.1063058338925
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards	64.47219537047839
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr	144.4227642427557
Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement	170.16972248355677
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr	74.81816962692928
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day	163.68859343990667
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out	80.65667917893911
Very few days passed in which Mr	61.11560245063246
Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours	101.22678638217063
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits	142.28996048644615
She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs	215.95551412991253
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family	93.59364995503319
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr	94.06931213299245
Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty	69.07194322490032
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first	193.26426679519813
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach	106.58660776870911
This
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors	154.85275732322484
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity	119.71383409264773
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	156.3286937521197
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important	140.98578127753254
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr	87.48190170592116
Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself	118.67436379911045
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr	71.55748154010737
Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence	125.8157263228525
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects	121.17118313805095
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr	90.67184722455121
Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr	73.97786719532456
Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	106.1476805448908
Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility	158.9968165508066
Mr	1.0
Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me	98.90547336419807
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	122.06942917290854
Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman	416.90250688221363
Mr	1.0
Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs	78.02849610863301
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure	105.718138005734
Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word	48.00701155597313
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs	211.80420442029381
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body	53.10063263964734
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family	124.28970966372152
She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"My eldest sister has been in town these three months	130.71601318858308
Have you never
happened to see her there	76.07691060698637
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet	75.3921890846978
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away	85.4224453477451
CHAPTER VIII	40.271554161662635
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings	87.38468496810319
It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening	114.89410599215367
For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter	71.18941428640998
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr	74.83244723188757
Darcy they had
only seen at church	415.1666356848551
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room	220.463683577414
Her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room	90.06602507692033
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs	110.94771664130641
Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much	240.1912312710035
He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr	144.91868657791008
Darcy	1.0
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam	157.46942451430687
What is it you are talking
of	83.1356012573678
What are you telling Miss Bennet	108.88982367119785
Let me hear what it is	23.990308518412757
"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply	132.491548549905
"Of music	56.547497257980325
Then pray speak aloud	67.18814743091674
It is of all subjects my delight	86.95248099792404
I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music	61.30887038583645
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste	353.6172214435776
If I had ever learnt, I
should have been a great proficient	35.452239964002146
And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply	217.20283890917625
I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully	38.421342092762146
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy	431.703959222778
Mr	1.0
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency	70.55506603334315
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal	55.16019339656763
"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice	95.87643695777604
She practises very constantly	282.18160714873466
"So much the better	21.854594368625094
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	131.0940846982801
I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice	206.0910042399443
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
Mrs	124.81413115807945
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
Mrs	104.51607314684924
Jenkinson's room	38.79612310636848
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house	39.86429418993025
Mr	1.0
Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer	88.7235988862444
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument	136.16413045561958
He
drew a chair near her	114.54355613145053
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance	192.08211735516815
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"You mean to frighten me, Mr	87.00703104089595
Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me	67.95532066106706
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well	122.52350151802095
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others	116.64624028331983
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me	89.52120297380276
"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own	105.17456748084857
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say	153.63838498652493
I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit	75.91160214575888
Indeed, Mr	9.732778406059325
Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear	114.94141556457842
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly	39.96493388925695
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam	129.55966509725974
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers	67.68971881116376
"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful	186.80376427212528
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did	99.91772251282933
He danced
only four dances	652.2970850407091
I am sorry to pain you--but so it was	159.7380351701662
He danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	226.6435177572198
Mr	1.0
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact	58.262827048118126
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party	169.9845463010282
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	132.65677777743034
Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next	259.0758020428135
My fingers wait your orders	206.7386871315132
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	178.15599299606063
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	70.39063762443928
said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam	72.59277146512554
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers	133.7135981361565
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him	135.39511032412503
It is because he will not give himself the trouble	46.24868077933332
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before	268.7461571412063
I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done	197.00528934374327
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do	91.39033821113617
They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression	68.60596221785028
But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
trouble of practising	62.799346175735245
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution	135.38756278496484
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right	49.550527832652534
You have employed your
time much better	69.55465576155261
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting	81.22962665273211
We neither of us perform to strangers	215.46645025154183
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of	43.431486284586605
Elizabeth immediately began playing again	356.605311713971
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,

"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master	75.15261337415606
She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's	50.56447797648993
Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn	79.97094917506902
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation	105.55101115284945
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste	172.8509622159521
Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home	69.83088849271644
CHAPTER IX	39.68442416583136
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs	61.96221515968037
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor	117.2942644395347
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr	134.33532160434493
Darcy, and Mr	12.580024721344245
Darcy only, entered the room	511.5445525602816
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within	133.76390953360274
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	191.52502466351646
It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr	167.52741930917867
Darcy	1.0
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr	95.40897675264178
Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before	175.58466761322669
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London	97.43858439107086
"Perfectly so--I thank you	27.377579762448793
She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"I think I have understood that Mr	61.98206126273521
Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again	123.31287482719128
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future	114.05460510792447
He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing	261.5388758858896
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there	128.27356531857973
But perhaps Mr	19.13070620008956
Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle	84.91537224212664
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers	77.15633987909241
Elizabeth made no answer	15.32137872178624
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him	75.18412168364073
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
house	76.58575829970108
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr	52.9276552660615
Collins first came to Hunsford	54.60696635053478
"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object	79.19494667867691
"Mr	1.0
Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	114.3928926300035
"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had	123.25308980189449
My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr	63.05963651215722
Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did	256.0402055834096
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her	103.23569599172062
"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends	74.33658174185999
"An easy distance do you call it	78.06368075439914
It is nearly fifty miles	18.187549139304295
"And what is fifty miles of good road	78.23400278166136
Little more than half a day's
journey	38.603342380607096
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance	53.913159504001015
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth	51.65648008294513
"I should never have said Mrs	55.15150457407518
Collins
was settled _near_ her family	61.33434783285655
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire	56.20965752117767
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far	205.0593831293858
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family	98.46427708503377
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances	296.70456640459156
Where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil	139.5260618500228
But that is not the
case _here_	57.30662647238067
Mr	1.0
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance	189.7990028328069
Mr	1.0
Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment	134.98674348541596
_You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn	36.34933292752225
Elizabeth looked surprised	15.256836236772987
The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"Are you pleased with Kent	183.74213928084757
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk	73.42978432057653
The tête-à-tête surprised
them	1171.1467472769468
Mr	1.0
Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away	134.56041266348345
"What can be the meaning of this	20.726038410653988
said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone	43.35086424226729
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way	127.30545719975541
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year	195.6998237394069
All field sports were over	58.49387342016558
Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day	92.49363181678896
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt	142.70966982833716
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind	127.19559065815638
But why Mr	50.79015082993885
Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand	73.69277775666626
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself	193.8365883312629
He seldom appeared really
animated	119.0465470372713
Mrs	1.0
Collins knew not what to make of him	107.49351996988423
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out	104.57831473114312
--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success	102.92430445096419
He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable	91.69631703682138
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind	115.48421438547771
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs	76.38982116677923
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power	108.58265401123595
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam	213.3327866662163
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr	289.78297248773674
Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all	67.20106625057208
CHAPTER X	36.142694885019736
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly
meet Mr	132.36852484673253
Darcy	1.0
--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers	126.06392577250524
--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd	78.84395060861381
--Yet it did, and even a third	126.33057737389437
It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	134.02278446085896
He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr	173.99311316317045
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too	153.62511874465272
His words
seemed to imply it	63.993258717584276
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts	131.35908141561904
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter	131.45932867655236
It distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
Parsonage	190.9520425020821
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr	118.98288351693458
Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her	144.71430126887842
Putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"I did not know before that you ever walked this way	64.6615743785889
"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage	133.25950228483725
Are
you going much farther	129.30113245503833
"No, I should have turned in a moment	39.772504139062
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together	112.83820778967126
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday	148.31417844966307
said she	4.3269098540289095
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again	97.2410646514044
But I am at his disposal	49.86672501902181
He
arranges the business just as he pleases	75.31823545873979
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice	71.99663940464603
I do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr	94.14422267221912
Darcy	1.0
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam	149.94128694053927
"But so we all do	95.55394208039947
It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor	122.6241192104031
I speak
feelingly	26.529515077242884
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence	89.91048894363259
"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of
either	72.00680774261544
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence	238.15798284246344
When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	262.7214303091476
"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature	76.54889162835283
But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the want of money	139.43464132519014
Younger sons cannot marry
where they like	64.75181451806041
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do	192.2225213792667
"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money	172.44172519425732
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me	94.16651994908534
and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is
the usual price of an Earl's younger son	88.24871070099766
Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	97.41052807927242
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped	87.80956897021379
To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal	156.83911013137313
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind	100.74041837892905
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her	103.71493044016916
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me	120.7613887626273
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy	40.03236923752431
"Are you, indeed	77.72212631294866
And pray what sort of guardians do you make	49.19612706175145
Does your
charge give you much trouble	103.42322003247466
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way	154.8473823166756
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth	127.06831947891673
She directly replied,

"You need not be frightened	96.92283204897267
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world	55.39741957269752
She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs	59.71569197824615
Hurst and
Miss Bingley	25.133523126635843
I think I have heard you say that you know them	36.10563699034532
"I know them a little	34.07398250325238
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's	56.87682023425759
"Oh	1.0
yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr	11.135926433903887
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr	68.05406101049869
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	68.59741458980501
"Care of him	7.793258175911476
--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care	346.0486708331194
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him	57.97369905984745
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant	71.00405416115915
It was all conjecture	26.24841526232502
"What is it you mean	68.3613716538664
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing	89.58069063137822
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it	53.07544622680732
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley	72.51467842580395
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	170.01948988503156
"Did Mr	35.224916635678056
Darcy give you his reasons for this interference	96.17327807102455
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady	91.71360717762379
"And what arts did he use to separate them	107.1816583343035
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling	175.43054339839517
"He
only told me, what I have now told you	48.59168887627599
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation	68.27734859833893
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful	127.9755261862941
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she	27.81403937113632
"Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings	197.04537255496805
Why was he to be the judge	100.0605487262233
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious	163.3830404409371
"I do not see what right Mr	85.2873063906893
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	118.13819968396466
"But,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him	114.55088550024024
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case	34.669944882539376
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly	144.0635788355815
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr	74.36192974466005
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage	197.74348286312122
There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard	74.95392316142585
It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	76.88670624980135
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr	98.48551448766933
Darcy could have
such boundless influence	58.99134400699473
That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr	35.24910920902764
Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them	76.47482122465416
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer	124.2936024400289
He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted	75.35354647962313
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London	264.253617345349
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection	195.67417757654573
All loveliness and goodness as she is	43.94177670168361
Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating	145.87952847202956
Neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr	201.4857011976018
Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach	114.8287393743514
When she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr	71.57136995021536
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr	120.556503633915
Bingley for his sister	28.70257862637249
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr	132.97053476430162
Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea	194.4677161255134
Mrs	1.0
Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr	121.80332702277596
Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home	88.60735367202594
CHAPTER XI	48.79236161531385
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr	89.9354277691528
Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent	114.97929353172499
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering	122.03028092996163
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded	96.51928437876573
Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	95.19852770265032
Mr	1.0
Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings	80.5927573991861
It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do	127.48135794602304
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him	101.68174506819348
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her	118.22807783955231
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr	96.79068027130239
Darcy walk into the
room	56.00566030291466
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	134.08098260336945
She answered him with cold civility	71.38378643253368
He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room	94.20267517529855
Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word	65.98250033521578
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"In vain have I struggled	184.366219350997
It will not do	12.123320605833555
My feelings will not be
repressed	72.14852798232043
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you	99.96078169677925
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression	131.26622586635014
She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent	61.71991471321505
This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed	177.22523990050738
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride	87.53523982118865
His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit	149.75704867970234
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger	105.18614073428668
She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done	277.0283579464454
He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand	107.83043549955958
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer	57.81306966955623
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security	254.59238167703128
Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned	164.3994562085229
It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you	72.78879449626731
But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly	116.66542106076069
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one	53.47794459589074
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
short duration	79.24441811507266
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation	186.37543057932098
Mr	1.0
Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise	116.40308339335682
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature	112.94448938297369
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it	68.62404468513981
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful	325.5165839233261
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting	76.59841711594159
I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected	222.45830914693704
But it is of small importance	29.04096109011213
"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character	179.32897012275214
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil	235.89715889794888
But I have
other provocations	17.20743614493646
You know I have	23.993230224310377
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister	147.45195503277262
As she pronounced these words, Mr	93.0908208602493
Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued	200.01685122521616
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you	38.6780869824896
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_	164.85426113815564
You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind	134.5712394569859
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	99.7464020760072
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	139.51676033863538
"Can you deny that you have done it	39.02181038467714
she repeated	64.87488156311136
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success	83.11175496871968
Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself	65.91332861301305
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her	221.29414559963132
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded	153.60959176590325
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided	82.14557169111424
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr	106.71238757294618
Wickham	1.0
On this subject, what can you have to
say	53.96663250277715
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	352.9794709695858
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others	100.46930845442053
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour	119.06577456264058
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him	69.6728059534535
"His misfortunes	25.55549911690463
repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed	141.19923486950034
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy	52.57612917941004
"You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty	90.90418070188721
You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him	51.47418457718834
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert	170.91007148242934
You have done all this	23.51445923289376
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule	98.6019819017228
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me	151.1523481426721
This is the estimation in which you hold me	72.72425639879737
I
thank you for explaining it so fully	116.89822047821258
My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed	118.03677568865015
But perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	349.82465660601093
These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing	203.5115857482628
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	173.57269897135654
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related	69.92874334451066
They were natural and just	68.64246826406433
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	69.33421078740191
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own	128.2788411611932
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"You are mistaken, Mr	91.15361663949167
Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner	110.30848832502306
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it	77.97731541614085
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	59.06096115730787
She went on	13.380206150997559
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry	96.27708983499689
"You have said quite enough, madam	114.2989868337471
I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	109.85755660707986
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness	164.83881927133712
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house	224.01072732598786
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great	40.15200133755404
She knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour	95.4982135056647
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it	77.12580638801066
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr	71.48567905410478
Darcy	1.0
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months	31.846462767543176
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible	92.79676641735001
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection	121.5968055016989
But his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr	105.5456914608277
Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	110.0374568896713
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room	158.25684285601895
CHAPTER XII	43.021281467720314
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes	34.170438337603876
She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	83.81846737012941
She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr	63.593863253848255
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road	115.55318716514124
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground	91.99651287347618
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park	89.72947904365496
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees	83.11666208136765
She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr	121.7154982264623
Darcy, she was directly retreating	39.97818613440903
But the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name	153.00251414684348
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be Mr	92.72097006500965
Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate	165.28293909715737
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	114.69884872117004
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter	106.33829169789784
--And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight	65.37128263394168
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand	161.88281882343614
--The envelope itself was likewise
full	251.65471077557044
--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it	98.76738866221753
It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you	142.66986370448657
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read	104.45642240683556
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
     attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
     demand it of your justice	243.25760358026247
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge	92.6304085789135
The first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached
     Mr	116.06633248476086
Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr	80.39690598014121
Wickham	1.0
--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison	100.86820203462682
--But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read	188.95921875944126
--If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry	158.44704278187345
--The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd	103.68634507271612
--I
     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country	87.09583054568701
--But it was not till the evening of the
     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment	85.96362517897822
--I had often seen him in love before	53.279203554941276
--At that
     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made
     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that
     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage	170.63686645051743
He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided	66.75785797808727
From that moment I
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then
     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
     ever witnessed in him	110.98521270851785
Your sister I also watched	159.439087240728
--Her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment	114.12272511134532
--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have
     been in an error	45.5822632940896
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable	225.35675961796966
--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable	104.19690512326
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched	98.94317877867782
--That I was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears	75.62829508374287
--I did not believe her to be
     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason	170.54998851352417
--My objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me	133.303175026988
--But there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me	203.96576148290163
--These causes
     must be stated, though briefly	353.72671496950227
--The situation of your mother's
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father	144.0241122291177
--Pardon me	17.67981813157954
--It pains me to offend you	58.670084423205004
But amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both	117.89392877277562
--I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection	222.18277828477224
--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning	199.27232375104663
--The part which I acted, is now to be explained	128.27683583499905
--His
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London	119.56967955932684
--We accordingly
     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice	144.04889870805502
--I described, and
     enforced them earnestly	58.509632207229764
--But, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference	89.31953117008722
He had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard	167.18481407164617
--But Bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own	111.94244153923941
--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point	160.4256111352242
To persuade him against
     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment	135.74179082695844
--I cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much	100.15618106058224
There is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town	93.28065452113265
I knew it myself, as
     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it	87.31622623335386
--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger	180.00407684540895
--Perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me	82.36979351424503
--It is done, however,
     and it was done for the best	40.470882245370255
--On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer	56.02866957292912
If I have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
     not yet learnt to condemn them	146.45236087006413
--With respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr	76.21523714058566
Wickham, I can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family	90.3110332226062
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity	66.24063946607426
Mr	1.0
Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed	140.9316046402688
My father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education	100.13809965476769
My father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it	111.13278918522819
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think
     of him in a very different manner	71.91747027583905
The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr	93.05797317739365
Darcy could not have	17.93146640320961
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell	91.51953503360046
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr	51.4153487118317
Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character	237.80819320176124
It adds even another motive	252.18144369231928
My excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr	157.1948608541036
Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant	147.7705962891407
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds	59.425461115509954
His own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, Mr	122.95236799503384
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited	138.5464487076569
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein	120.56751980068836
I rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal	102.83334995691001
I knew that Mr	25.86851022881085
Wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman	24.951365457579005
The business was therefore soon settled	149.08268291274405
He resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds	100.07134358473023
All connection between us seemed now dissolved	83.75990841839992
I
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
     society in town	105.65458126398015
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation	118.54310406756336
For
     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation	109.97720345603297
His circumstances, he
     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad	85.0040161797631
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions	101.62471220850264
You will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it	59.80979407698341
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself	111.0717393989644
After this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt	296.99217890423716
How he lived I know not	66.84998172706297
But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	118.8767310232739
I
     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being	126.68520648614152
Having said thus much, I feel no
     doubt of your secrecy	100.96856290478797
My sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
     Fitzwilliam, and myself	83.18098447141996
About a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;
     and thither also went Mr	117.79376735089929
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs	147.6213225910288
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement	101.78299883144796
She was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
     herself	131.14005635699687
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me	103.38203827947632
You may imagine what I felt
     and how I acted	63.70448417100799
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr	125.7831954453228
Wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and Mrs	77.90396009641451
Younge was of course removed from
     her charge	27.626618553841254
Mr	1.0
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement	76.7257514952303
His revenge would have been complete indeed	87.61600535129764
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards Mr	92.96153936964511
Wickham	1.0
I know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at	200.15537036218268
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination	101.49596404098291
You may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night	90.5888008707034
But I was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	92.60392515992143
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions	158.54387592709003
If your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning	81.65193074540205
I will only add, God bless you	207.22167797233465
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY	57.55525492472955
CHAPTER XIII	50.811904919547814
If Elizabeth, when Mr	43.80691083646544
Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents	84.8534924039975
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	136.80915613830638
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	146.87798221928426
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal	110.64147271707371
With a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield	65.67179592038975
She read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes	138.53614578019315
His belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice	133.92698916377563
He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty	129.52556007958452
It
was all pride and insolence	20.36859944038211
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr	110.67986087070368
Wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	188.05949548238755
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her	3139.193850574078
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false	116.56656498669184
This cannot be	18.917782034903883
This must be the grossest falsehood	35.28512444976294
--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again	119.7806798736079
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	110.25405738495635
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr	66.566021016215
Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words	103.46162837991213
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great	127.6212176867672
What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err	115.42632036253052
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate	129.40404822265052
She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success	113.06073643412904
On both sides it was only assertion	343.89267942621757
Again she read on	24.09112986042188
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render Mr	286.1915756900539
Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	86.82776639005394
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr	118.7791042136422
Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice	148.54334186899283
She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance	95.07776313278202
Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself	103.71991324813273
As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring	72.79425571928857
His countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue	87.63123663226597
She tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr	213.99713722734526
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr	77.92204094365239
Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	137.24714396007482
But no
such recollection befriended her	126.10574692986364
She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess	134.29902917310474
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read	237.65923742679774
But, alas	102.9459604673723
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question	156.50481060234995
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr	94.83939445149404
Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration	62.20617181520562
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr	162.6370249988803
Philips's	1.0
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	196.51342300079295
She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before	93.09677187764242
She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct	111.83614813309903
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr	65.29495450610428
Darcy--that Mr	6.879321209164941
Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week	114.93461276797021
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr	171.4595483995057
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son	101.07241165655117
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	126.82024944089423
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing	131.45556218278807
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn	143.7471859831932
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr	101.90924395033358
Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr	34.24836960265438
Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits	105.82091916977424
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling	147.72399258155244
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr	105.07881507802459
Bingley, was incomprehensible	68.69008646559145
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself	104.79278018804935
--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd	127.45897047490799
"How despicably have I acted	75.88671673853432
she cried	12.618412199228171
--"I, who have prided myself on
my discernment	123.38577560356808
--I, who have valued myself on my abilities	268.00385225490464
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust	136.20746505486773
--How humiliating is this
discovery	137.1403572674808
--Yet, how just a humiliation	195.86487131061386
--Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind	62.512435326481565
But vanity, not love, has been my
folly	297.03476478029324
--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned	124.02402587090026
Till this moment, I never knew myself	89.24311050591785
From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr	110.91588925221916
Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again	87.72959736775152
Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal	45.70496760094917
--How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other	65.5566252871596
--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been	83.17764041138585
--Neither could she
deny the justice of his description of Jane	118.28844983942264
--She felt that Jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility	110.89517736513866
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe	132.6497290928609
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers	140.74342062687043
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt	77.9216998764444
It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before	103.20181984080855
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	108.58204109619078
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr	148.10868901332955
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found	98.79995330027187
--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it	99.1228056069629
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object	59.95451922411322
She could think only of her letter	48.910022210579754
CHAPTER XIV	46.23386779260451
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr	76.48874554875266
Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings	182.21038204593944
To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her	83.85719592479957
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been	119.69214487205059
"What would she have said	115.20769977885652
--how
would she have behaved	301.87474771389157
were questions with which she amused herself	164.01244367112227
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party	72.86180113082352
--"I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do	87.40062903474974
But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me	50.54612925586226
--They were excessively sorry to go	44.90929945041698
But so they always are	140.24656092779244
The dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year	325.2439631557958
His
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases	73.72661574735119
Mr	1.0
Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	108.21252130691718
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer	90.49447384901713
Mrs	1.0
Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure	28.749166721517273
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it	49.9446056505129
--I must be in town
next Saturday	240.9257344967239
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks	257.1802666581412
I expected
you to stay two months	71.76104921179622
I told Mrs	18.953746328953486
Collins so before you came	155.9265933740869
There
can be no occasion for your going so soon	39.13961856919516
Mrs	1.0
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight	550.8364528505359
"But my father cannot	30.72925965954608
--He wrote last week to hurry my return	193.67021302625886
"Oh	1.0
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can	263.3804676201128
--Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father	95.33886750739966
And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large	111.6808251775807
"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan	110.53690949571754
Lady Catherine seemed resigned	12.329539892044822
"Mrs	1.0
Collins, you must send a servant with them	67.33342001261786
You know I always
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves	84.64298400244033
It is highly improper	35.97632742911496
You must contrive to send
somebody	69.1816297452471
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing	78.28545426580547
--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life	85.84142852099139
When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
with her	210.88113050481428
--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr	38.3574968875191
Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner	86.54922742370148
--I
am excessively attentive to all those things	63.87565650425309
You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs	44.19912216313665
Collins	1.0
I am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone	89.42983669945167
"My uncle is to send a servant for us	70.84689681210313
"Oh	1.0
--Your uncle	21.666082648235875
--He keeps a man-servant, does he	90.97565127646403
--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things	176.8231156692129
Where shall you change
horses	187.44471647224117
--Oh	1.0
Bromley, of course	13.49180425704469
--If you mention my name at the Bell,
you will be attended to	36.78320784788904
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was	104.2702017724137
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections	142.8487028966811
Mr	1.0
Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	109.29223815376791
She
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different	81.57491596600784
When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	154.45957073631328
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	257.0325758878458
In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	69.67659273553711
They were hopeless of remedy	76.37369422104312
Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil	99.5298291077998
Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement	154.56498720756156
Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing	142.21516459654868
They were ignorant, idle, and vain	101.7970885608089
While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever	119.36223108656763
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr	157.6969471809795
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost	98.23414672518477
His affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend	90.85693335610665
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family	123.90919593184044
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	114.34737319547583
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first	114.49921885715422
The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh	179.8575733800235
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both	127.66588809317138
CHAPTER XV	42.39216444237812
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr	144.66427638669774
Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	97.15839319741988
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs	124.97687223440046
Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it	80.26985195737115
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you	101.51444291499537
We know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	69.2129378690237
Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly	112.70443320654813
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	57.74403111833814
She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged	156.6142415011464
Mr	1.0
Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably	99.14718316729893
We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	173.85919753061174
Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	156.9784778290054
You see on
what a footing we are	107.17578018253738
You see how continually we are engaged there	121.11932406841996
In
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings	92.02300714149656
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences	62.33928302495231
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin	102.88967292722097
I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so	37.77649415781125
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs	39.38056390298623
Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent	76.7908714399134
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage	181.74377312550354
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking	88.55398040760856
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us	69.68436991117447
We seem to have been designed for each
other	22.929162288213316
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	89.84800675711385
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung	69.83495982764377
Poor Charlotte	35.567435943096726
--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society	92.89499889141244
--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion	99.70328914845659
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms	158.7861712972007
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready	84.59098770923653
After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr	89.92570724695071
Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr	88.3178551537293
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner, though unknown	45.08691473992747
He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings	90.85467210581767
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here	118.10208350562081
Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off	56.608488486973485
"Good gracious	5.9547309865505715
cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came	83.19119036415978
--and yet how many things have
happened	158.60706682235693
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh	137.8577238087412
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice	583.6372209826031
--How much I shall have to tell	43.98931126349934
Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal	89.56092003828269
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr	227.81662357929284
Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days	46.973315181429335
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them	83.2089987235215
But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	92.14943940899556
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr	79.01220612377286
Darcy's proposals	20.224312267538817
To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther	115.26344494893323
CHAPTER XVI	39.85745414057073
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr	133.60069557009993
Bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs	161.4411557386917
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber	70.09860539700205
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is not this nice	252.43874592274926
is not this an agreeable surprise	698.627219909429
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	166.90549850128184
Then shewing
her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet	124.61739038522978
I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not	63.42893651018413
I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better	86.39553825282408
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh	196.1487031271319
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable	92.42912770510846
Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight	90.76628401989163
"Are they indeed	80.30627144553766
cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction	29.38641192235499
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer	71.18880362283537
It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	48.90598597185761
Mamma would like to
go too of all things	60.88238588677037
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have	581.7897672411834
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once	314.8624520285677
Good Heaven	12.345262921033322
Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton	93.15582642754593
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to
table	82.13430534110346
"What do you think	13.537261818806913
It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like	127.25499217388248
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay	51.04661020795767
Lydia laughed, and said,

"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion	232.17381699460933
You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared	111.7961150059407
I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say	79.53423084207927
But he is an ugly fellow	54.2863539189246
I am glad
he is gone	18.29258652631288
I never saw such a long chin in my life	42.04676255486517
Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it	89.90474079457509
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King	144.70500048416042
There's for you	14.247480488609911
She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay	48.36064452899852
Wickham is safe	59.306033337601974
"And Mary King is safe	425.2555489695147
added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune	122.30646990258639
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him	48.822133707498004
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane	51.222979219391135
"I am sure there is not on _his_	18.079981775033886
I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her	193.7012779478789
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing	57.896344090777944
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal	195.49950558260758
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it	144.8825283031822
"How nicely we are crammed in	18.266189971556678
cried Lydia	11.455470701575369
"I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox	112.16819018131724
Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home	139.75337866984245
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away	51.357518916957865
Have you seen any pleasant men	107.15958987732282
Have you had any
flirting	55.14018216372555
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back	88.79850961293722
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare	111.22270279252234
She is almost three and twenty	111.96070033192416
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty	144.89094432923667
My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think	103.28058044168196
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr	94.53579307205423
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it	55.13508410151511
Lord	1.0
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls	64.70564793138519
Dear me	17.774582038497687
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's	117.78714403682741
Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs	98.86829869345254
Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs	94.3687645578651
Forster and me are _such_ friends	206.22528396738704
and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did	94.11972350230484
We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun	101.00189452497716
Not a soul knew of it, but Col	105.37407874681992
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked	91.94756614779368
When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least	95.94238176946314
Lord	1.0
how I laughed	58.94666365139379
and so did Mrs	79.64574556128763
Forster	1.0
I thought I should have died	38.938792769945664
And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter	179.22859549938067
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn	105.40439703652338
Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name	69.61530640763783
Their reception at home was most kind	70.00704380674148
Mrs	1.0
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr	92.78249476771661
Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,

"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy	68.49845402817787
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs	169.8435562484567
Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	118.45177590551725
"Oh	1.0
Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun	175.6303755510313
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too	112.36971058437854
And then when we came away it was such fun	125.7339763317746
I thought
we never should have got into the coach	68.21980809124052
I was ready to die of laughter	79.2185274242065
And then we were so merry all the way home	72.04132848581156
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off	77.29743630767194
To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures	289.5564212513564
They would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds	123.43147296754572
But I confess they would have no charms
for _me_	48.67311246411813
I should infinitely prefer a book	82.57531454742058
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word	107.00398519515916
She seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all	81.22940175727472
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme	133.47039838322087
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	50.65490071627144
There was
another reason too for her opposition	117.60941327498145
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	88.12320111656535
The comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression	271.30726151952916
In
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account	85.24353549453785
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents	97.07934068811247
Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	87.76781614464052
CHAPTER XVII	36.78408853961752
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr	124.95780909352017
Darcy and herself	21.215333570536707
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	118.96461948949593
She was
sorry that Mr	20.770315072873352
Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him	189.55828003098117
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment	185.10621938392103
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	91.08931073843154
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him	77.35979656837138
"Blame you	2.251136879278976
Oh, no	22.265453046672118
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham	74.88626322151809
"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	40.204774114636194
"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day	76.65368991616322
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham	81.9414144734764
What a stroke was this for poor Jane	196.89696427916633
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual	116.29483270487017
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery	168.96375692690492
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other	121.04736210064786
"This will not do," said Elizabeth	29.22587559916375
"You never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing	68.31517993443954
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one	54.822315823989236
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much	66.17877517080252
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr	46.16293512587893
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse	94.43495406547545
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane	78.92430068284281
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she	31.044059701626193
"Wickham so
very bad	42.527211396321476
It is almost past belief	22.163765798618574
And poor Mr	100.23158169579047
Darcy	1.0
dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered	151.6076072730054
Such a disappointment	22.630696147814902
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too	63.76887372203075
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister	81.89905400058917
It is really too distressing	67.46799646006022
I am sure you must feel it
so	22.295587875470815
"Oh	1.0
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both	145.92558030397183
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	111.31012469453194
Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather	135.75745537922114
"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance	56.89701808906328
such an openness and gentleness in his manner	82.42783050002653
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men	119.6238813030866
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it	68.68998092857605
"I never thought Mr	38.51235837959609
Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do	45.431494014787226
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason	157.63200538023196
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	94.03244680013377
One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty	143.20180581175381
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now	68.76966890508957
"Indeed I could not	8.9473579492672
I was uncomfortable enough	49.7139531302206
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy	83.51187277334392
And with no one to speak to, of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had	113.44210334248703
Oh	1.0
how I wanted you	69.88940706220885
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr	103.5653439023459
Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved	130.85988631878328
"Certainly	1.0
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging	105.8384390888857
There is
one point, on which I want your advice	93.28205941708634
I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham's character	94.59765932391335
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	78.83009618917089
What is your own opinion	58.50036580292688
"That it ought not to be attempted	28.855972670006583
Mr	1.0
Darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public	126.20551386342667
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me	70.82970431624364
The general prejudice against Mr	149.59332372415366
Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light	89.62027057618775
I am not equal to it	21.813031357306553
Wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is	146.6590038704982
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	128.01046677870357
At present I will
say nothing about it	57.435994006579556
"You are quite right	27.779572015425494
To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever	142.65638023842666
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character	95.69761149968238
We must not make him desperate	41.59649532295753
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation	52.176078736389094
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either	77.81670190679503
But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure	65.71351980383328
She dared not relate the other
half of Mr	84.48440794211642
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend	55.300886802642424
Here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery	112.8472917748493
"And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	162.01989178333324
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	208.1692295195637
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits	66.63511701359518
Jane was not happy	19.236675980819314
She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley	56.94851252606808
Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity	191.06480891671143
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs	16.8242011565266
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's	90.96652432789877
For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody	94.13160151707311
I told my sister Philips so the other day	160.6482620603599
But I
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London	48.63181586558759
Well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now	137.71469518564362
There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know	66.77713623900263
"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more	54.653863258341566
"Oh, well	233.3570891726007
it is just as he chooses	26.816062069832352
Nobody wants him to come	26.804923077035
Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it	65.41210015798804
Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done	59.41573215887834
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer	141.42308652223247
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they	123.21601903960448
Well, well, I only hope it
will last	166.20128054309953
And what sort of table do they keep	185.28670159557888
Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say	34.406338361896054
If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough	92.27122459048329
There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say	82.66325847502358
"No, nothing at all	35.66726612346919
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it	56.65025672515172
Yes, yes	271.8217323589023
_They_ will
take care not to outrun their income	42.99987863208929
_They_ will never be distressed
for money	46.77317581371365
Well, much good may it do them	468.3909683764093
And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead	158.19807818184495
They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens	191.54911209682706
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me	58.4787340934682
"No	1.0
It would have been strange if they had	31.867457266875643
But I make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves	138.71997260906298
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better	74.51476487535359
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	151.09076340184836
CHAPTER XVIII	34.82033085670652
The first week of their return was soon gone	114.29620364054496
The second began	147.52998688131325
It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace	46.43283762968373
The dejection was almost
universal	68.68080463973158
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments	135.09725742619582
Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family	127.90770699290874
"Good Heaven	12.345262921033322
What is to become of us	38.574526210430406
What are we to do	58.33053049741891
would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe	42.073274189069515
"How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy	142.22196635178116
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago	161.1937782659246
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
Millar's regiment went away	110.07480823354597
I thought I should have broke my heart	59.082513449180716
"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia	83.99056869559737
"If one could but go to Brighton	105.19735861607191
observed Mrs	14.658513691695019
Bennet	1.0
"Oh, yes	4.891929890542565
--if one could but go to Brighton	105.19735861607191
But papa is so
disagreeable	72.97700367506754
"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever	85.33304434657296
"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty	92.35636704044713
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn-house	337.8807603610205
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame	153.014854203993
She felt anew the justice of Mr	41.62187232219211
Darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend	105.50389469765265
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs	149.03757579684108
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton	143.04313457773753
This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married	138.65162131954935
A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_	95.95426514381954
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs	132.20172926907134
Forster,
the delight of Mrs	100.84852171183701
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described	97.05881501139064
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	154.323631520906
"I cannot see why Mrs	57.73196455492273
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend	56.74948041307758
I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older	138.32998388965964
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned	91.33980421341055
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go	77.96681527613939
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs	108.20471494637009
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home	120.56797351025435
He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances	117.00350192571115
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair	109.81273984521951
"Already arisen	60.0382352668962
repeated Mr	21.8893325500473
Bennet	1.0
"What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers	422.0670277182899
Poor little Lizzy	207.26958868973105
But do not be cast down	46.202511745278926
Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret	55.94250631394081
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly	112.98567924100482
"Indeed you are mistaken	40.698224623013395
I have no such injuries to resent	35.16499319237987
It is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining	109.04811656404671
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character	80.21307083747051
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly	65.91618627801351
If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment	79.64905499567617
Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous	129.47987742106304
A flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	163.09053725008783
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended	785.2832437484506
She will follow wherever Lydia leads	333.3630788479274
Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled	74.54038072703523
Oh	1.0
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace	61.88796594394244
Mr	1.0
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love	117.47236280372543
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
sisters	113.78004622617648
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton	52.80720407249181
Let her go then	114.86500838541328
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body	76.27060254512894
At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here	136.23918794467733
The officers will find
women better worth their notice	244.63504470405525
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance	164.15213127710322
At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life	104.86292893040859
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry	87.07758800530827
It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them	68.4763543433448
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition	78.14907326713788
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility	140.1752539030469
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness	140.42487437931425
She saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	79.99292442795823
She
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown	55.084853671937445
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once	104.8256585116808
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations	115.22827979328207
They could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same	68.47528583449342
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself	123.8701179658482
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home	223.44033027372237
Elizabeth was now to see Mr	35.67517382372354
Wickham for the last time	33.70427906642085
Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so	118.84873682532181
She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	153.9019864634081
In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her	266.2940254801218
She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	188.1862102503007
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr	124.79316923528611
Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	77.09935151195728
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him	140.8324053321675
Her answer was warmly in his favour	160.6593024780917
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you
say that he was at Rosings	75.28736308517858
"Nearly three weeks	18.727181203059374
"And you saw him frequently	56.886769233837484
"Yes, almost every day	23.94207074372371
"His manners are very different from his cousin's	59.68263611992385
"Yes, very different	10.16106625779551
But I think Mr	27.938020165274107
Darcy improves on acquaintance	87.91671729837057
"Indeed	1.0
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her	74.73397048312162
"And pray
may I ask	235.80318058466983
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in
address that he improves	162.20549362423083
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style	183.43181600428056
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials	218.86042722632095
"Oh, no	22.265453046672118
said Elizabeth	3.699587899331731
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was	53.91828498657412
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning	179.50256489177985
There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood	139.1859588312322
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr	109.10050876233024
Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right	157.20537326189643
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by	118.33527431230112
I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe	153.60442346446618
His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart	57.52123681332194
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head	55.26396693455116
She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him	98.71593064571267
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again	127.45441646395827
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs	81.43898429359317
Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning	93.24253239880743
The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic	179.6206824906055
Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy	112.29431130356095
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard	90.00420872167942
CHAPTER XIX	30.209671984467978
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort	132.9218830933312
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	102.86539864304315
Respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown	321.2978865650846
But Mr	11.575292088471809
Bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	220.84049417843255
He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments	55.876022464003434
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	136.37888551080297
This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	221.11625446355205
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband	61.110699332819166
She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible	120.66549272980582
But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	184.7696200735896
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	116.49762449627354
Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp	150.669610900737
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself	132.7702877436799
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment	138.12884265958533
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect	91.8583109055435
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for	59.18716164600517
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain	90.98501286045564
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized	96.71122651798706
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation	234.0255710813858
When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short	120.991933026087
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs	101.57700963952372
Forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public	94.9785786871888
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn	65.49855925105142
Everything wore
a happier aspect	153.43552465731557
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose	108.5025936693063
Mrs	1.0
Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton	188.63449152088003
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs	140.85714464608836
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent	66.63073332870634
Mr	1.0
Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire	133.34958011651722
In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs	92.52374502462503
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	111.72674883856354
The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak	131.13581675090344
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough	144.95345867095875
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again	102.41222761389486
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected	91.77957575573058
It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner	68.45438059966628
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	144.1159043476682
The period of expectation was now doubled	39.68630891237852
Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival	66.92190575405387
But they did pass away, and Mr	118.37473009207167
and
Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn	95.10110441577233
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them	166.68380810565031
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	85.65939925390188
One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad	193.8578801221916
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c	92.94315490275918
are
sufficiently known	601.7571268223132
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern	52.235157778886226
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs	155.52510398422183
Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated	197.89594513035647
It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it	100.55228089367327
In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs	181.27412061202023
Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again	77.0516251599656
Mr	1.0
Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	111.79317512071975
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much	62.76341404782441
said her aunt	22.61735469198399
"A place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected	232.2530046987319
Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know	161.98015193548665
Elizabeth was distressed	21.217646885881514
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	53.987224632500855
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	161.10955505393937
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner abused her stupidity	954.8876504052356
"If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful	124.68084162902034
They have some of the finest woods in the
country	78.26748753892258
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce	29.203617605337115
The
possibility of meeting Mr	44.556883359604605
Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred	133.9571228291639
It would be dreadful	26.79063367258585
She blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk	112.5238860965808
But against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered	120.74507180262012
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer	157.70359920865837
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme	104.1564150682543
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go	71.64681268792906

PRIDE & PREJUDICE	9.830222372472232
CHAPTER I	4.88293655229344
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter	79.90394672677127
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground	98.81690270048564
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent	110.6801565947854
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view	127.45876618915263
They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound	152.69602767064987
It was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance	191.33227471890433
Its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned	243.2051499097544
Elizabeth was delighted	19.463123756782178
She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	173.66451930162881
They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something	76.27037731095001
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned	171.24957427312765
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken	66.04802610444654
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was	52.64038961679184
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her	111.32994457909825
They
followed her into the dining-parlour	45.63939756530155
It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up	49.067746315269574
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect	150.3368393261716
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object	310.89610810960045
Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight	133.74042406960152
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen	202.63508984824782
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings	219.54414361095232
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress	66.06289772884647
With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted	231.8067829475651
Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt	69.08264769608341
--But no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them	46.47308187915906
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret	139.54330229648056
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it	79.76258033461654
At length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs	88.85116032313603
Reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends	96.16131214007768
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	249.12964303803003
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture	97.56882820107154
She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr	119.47902395377679
Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece	110.43562676688136
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it	162.43660171990047
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence	89.71875927822524
--"He is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild	86.27565594533372
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it	38.68974081087083
"And that," said Mrs	59.92107197943092
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him	120.61492381338385
It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago	49.18965702416472
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs	117.0888124556443
Gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face	76.58007480180348
But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not	54.57977514325196
Mrs	1.0
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master	109.45066061180594
"Does that young lady know Mr	157.32051293662644
Darcy	1.0
Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little	35.9648992142988
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am	70.76851093665083
"Yes, very handsome	16.960737405418627
"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this	64.36928203509152
This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then	218.1773490552434
He was very fond of them	17.58926855960183
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr	71.74975496569722
Wickham's being among them	75.97374648197531
Mrs	1.0
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old	319.2592727267578
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother	90.59224649400328
said Mr	13.044264543226825
Gardiner	1.0
"Oh	1.0
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished	120.69761946515916
--She plays and sings all day long	46.83614592613824
In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him	197.04103134434402
Mr	1.0
Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs	168.1526280386389
Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister	99.5597806328153
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year	55.25895715540329
"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months	113.44711454000912
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate	89.78264304868387
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him	119.59032403653958
"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be	35.063187322863186
I do not know who is
good enough for him	49.839603545216285
Mr	1.0
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner smiled	347.53746635991627
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so	39.15704486661888
"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other	95.18579711920364
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four years old	152.09415278234061
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas	172.07176981699223
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion	60.11805258110322
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"There are very few people of whom so much can be said	98.5718171717037
You are lucky in
having such a master	138.70233379527733
"Yes, Sir, I know I am	28.762353975060048
If I was to go through the world, I could not
meet with a better	51.40845254299915
But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world	176.2725641472231
Elizabeth almost stared at her	54.86447360147745
--"Can this be Mr	215.9317554759671
Darcy	1.0
thought she	4.505531257381257
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs	149.32238429572888
Gardiner	1.0
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor	90.30828697496527
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more	376.4082478668937
Mrs	1.0
Reynolds could interest her on no other point	127.55344628148313
She related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain	52.61401109991766
Mr	1.0
Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase	153.68101388949216
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived	139.12471380371227
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves	81.10400458424657
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name	57.84056704705708
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw any thing of it	44.06640139081256
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men	110.60573329649463
"In what an amiable light does this place him	232.94967866725617
thought Elizabeth	7.670612474507798
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend	129.22314886434177
"Perhaps we might be deceived	53.11154520674881
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good	79.49823396618548
On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at Pemberley	104.50994216591263
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows	78.98045272526736
Mrs	1.0
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room	64.66082262382433
"And this is always the way with him," she added	55.969800185938844
--"Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment	60.658326996285744
There
is nothing he would not do for her	25.332263736936365
The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn	83.53462396486158
In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible	135.23390160801495
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger	162.17278503783754
Elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her	111.82494189879198
At last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr	82.9529084869039
Darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her	66.96053286578615
She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery	95.53787256074592
Mrs	1.0
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time	74.49629236396426
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance	116.11173537626308
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs	84.82996309681346
Reynolds
was of no trifling nature	268.2462331526992
What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant	99.24561900585616
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship	127.05596631740099
--How
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow	49.199831719346534
--How much of
good or evil must be done by him	63.2580941698106
Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression	148.7266820904087
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door	114.79797480996223
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables	167.84917643731438
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight	52.663369102653974
Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush	251.87035820438427
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility	145.84044031288101
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome	85.19692457802715
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr	180.44276259908904
Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it	145.66258826887378
They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family	240.0973090429334
Amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life	116.28449916237457
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts	136.73069557439118
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave	99.02117246173867
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence	111.07470558019118
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation	45.72916182135176
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world	68.19859633195448
How strange must it appear to him	82.66137906354932
In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	329.4979605565692
It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	46.416047515728685
Oh	1.0
why did she come	57.37199717142287
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected	101.0685090527441
Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	106.17771311480845
She blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting	101.50037803563997
And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean	66.07551689885406
That he should even speak to
her was amazing	72.39775343789213
--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family	63.50483504993369
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	513.5158245321189
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
he put his letter into her hand	149.2414632701283
She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it	113.11913850900044
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene	92.09522510727625
Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr	92.89404501229049
Darcy then
was	46.10205095958126
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him	89.60531675868303
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease	96.28998205570979
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure	89.46511970098705
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	136.7796704466412
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream	166.94845425939477
Mr	1.0
Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk	118.43803718465401
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round	115.44178983325281
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts	120.55121511460895
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it	150.49181499620286
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs	86.90237366145588
Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	113.77895743294512
Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr	144.68527039017613
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little	90.73508105182792
Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr	264.63832139336495
Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance	138.21328847224126
The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met	120.55714771822906
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them	131.41953885684677
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	48.50941171364002
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them	218.88733844755038
With a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed	98.51128018383409
Her colour
changed, and she said no more	80.94713339435602
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	100.31723186628781
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself	90.76747071383907
"What will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are	66.5455110562758
He takes them now for people of
fashion	194.6996236412513
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions	143.85728756790093
That he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr	79.03555427670142
Gardiner	1.0
Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph	85.49649081963412
It was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush	129.93044028225745
She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners	128.83886565034177
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr	241.83300886413707
Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport	125.87521782864071
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder	119.65515254070738
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself	97.26725444733091
Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered	363.63997549419366
From
what can it proceed	94.35315131420563
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened	79.54453298039732
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this	98.89519741853893
It is impossible that he should still love
me	81.7493467332645
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration	137.31029693002748
It originated in
Mrs	127.74505401845771
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's	100.7907178244953
Mr	1.0
Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together	81.56404254535808
After a short silence, the lady first spoke	84.03594612716455
She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country	85.8815607718827
He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	90.3315148601991
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr	217.1457017875273
Bingley and his sisters	22.762634020050076
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	104.90531786995825
Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr	57.46009442737224
Bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged	73.06615915375477
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton	122.12476662969645
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	72.95780629589564
She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her	87.83564646386368
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought	125.9396156716423
Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased	128.84806842911564
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind	66.49345005170098
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr	44.13901237581314
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind	148.6615493659271
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn	105.77560190192325
At such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward	73.01134403370115
She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject	89.97004189367959
At last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with
great perseverance	51.66421544539618
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over	187.09876377734366
On
Mr	15.732676339428439
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness	134.11216138159955
Mr	1.0
Darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house	109.54859578317848
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	81.03751041718806
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle	73.30070760684659
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming	71.3222927424933
I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it	101.59479981912884
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	85.02574301009847
It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention	80.55880559479637
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling	59.74276709955084
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good	113.2850955488543
But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable	66.5604725137256
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning	59.74534815497948
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle	55.43132960709173
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds	162.54896098583248
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing	86.60812934944622
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs	65.6141721401404
Gardiner, "I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor Wickham	84.3848212702133
He has not an ill-natured
look	31.99678276146052
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks	119.35012560124396
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	89.18345495133177
But to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character	164.0381203377346
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	205.31649415941533
But he is a
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue	62.877240423753214
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire	99.32147540705293
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on	105.69976591985052
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else	71.75081379580075
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	95.42669748444547
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr	100.78179483125561
Darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	65.77554495232866
CHAPTER II	30.593157938584177
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr	81.02517826269892
Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	138.87480004722744
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came	363.5699747607484
They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street	102.61490146984673
Elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected	89.53463407435159
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business	110.39480504805556
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece	125.95200428373069
While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing	98.6190230048278
She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	144.67731231364374
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse	105.36643984865584
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place	131.77762948229693
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	171.8318976497502
Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy	117.36312901090604
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable	83.47907567620953
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful	106.8577304113606
She was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle	73.47776309170708
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr	81.99245520797425
Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings	120.95472841417887
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room	114.24384808550755
All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again	162.7080971420637
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done	116.73696749820704
To Mr	15.977427655529677
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself	97.16477281888034
They had long wished to see him	35.424140426643675
The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention	202.26154425618932
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr	81.67695727891355
Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love	216.4694957590461
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough	171.84375237647768
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do	75.91760711024165
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	123.20298116889116
Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased	94.52994596354381
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh	159.5562945252995
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner	153.49868480337517
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance	162.91503117425276
But, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane	51.75858366885886
No look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard	142.1821953118757
Nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister	112.33845917476424
On this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared	139.04719325722428
He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It
is above eight months	80.61593593164048
We have not met since the 26th of November, when
we were all dancing together at Netherfield	63.46909958568584
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn	145.84084986205528
There was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning	76.42022068654785
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr	50.43115241313252
Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day	152.84085663024626
When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible	133.4557914070314
Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings	179.9888073738589
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, Mr	87.34876354242142
Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr	66.89442305564148
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country	41.284369034020905
Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed	92.42927352529243
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head	165.23983535081447
Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on	146.02877414278947
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends	192.8719189229515
Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little	120.5565196251912
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress	117.17508297965209
But she had no reason to fear Mr	36.50190886397762
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication	141.0133622296493
It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr	22.444359096425767
Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her	47.846128902549374
They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry	388.5117299795114
Of Mr	12.68105899963048
Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find	105.58533368531153
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr	92.18301010915691
Darcy	1.0
There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected	116.44437940554624
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight	126.90464927032157
They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit	131.01548859790327
It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor	102.36498430326135
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr	123.03150459048993
Darcy afterwards discharged	122.32060869595735
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out	121.0780166505025
She
certainly did not hate him	52.733114378898016
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called	89.12553546462453
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced	160.1187079249164
But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked	227.31527335341917
It was gratitude	27.90491698201514
--Gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	90.98294462669874
He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister	148.91058985659745
Such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined	111.84427930610047
She respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	128.1819553654105
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning	75.31861320698346
They were, therefore, to go	43.2656151856051
--Elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply	88.68906199084145
Mr	1.0
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast	135.3057300982434
The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon	152.29799131707804
CHAPTER III	31.267591934088102
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed	120.69870844107778
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	208.54585379716872
Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	102.98540812873647
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs	88.42620659284712
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London	58.57646423068174
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved	171.54792173036506
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her	134.65904483323493
By Mrs	16.15619317556003
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments	117.84335410516925
It was first broken by Mrs	59.908516328422095
Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs	127.28967137365443
Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on	129.9708536529631
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard	118.32783065685916
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention	105.72560278699903
This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much	118.01992238283763
Her own thoughts were employing her	42.770082807398374
She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	75.5924339216819
She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine	128.44186436710928
After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family	151.43431831279455
She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more	71.36383545755946
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs	132.2787743225755
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post	67.43056369948378
There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table	61.33272741988103
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr	80.04196621873909
Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came	66.76309714515045
He had been some time with Mr	20.876638497282332
Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning	133.92473890814156
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room	94.69738852332598
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr	135.5951363824348
Darcy were by no means over	136.0752493371134
Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side	82.75589853730747
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton	174.4916340899051
They must be a great loss to _your_ family	23.361347366949662
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	69.0787330844989
While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes	163.97674674007817
Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps	123.3572708425068
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated
elopement	75.43790407791626
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own	171.4182737193195
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend	99.387741806567
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more	238.6959687873895
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully	126.29691185510875
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while Mr	91.8404048408687
Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress	163.15773833672546
But Georgiana would not join
her	73.96854914256132
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable	122.30225335340835
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister	78.45064967427236
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr	278.1633529188252
Darcy," she cried; "I
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	97.28834287853937
She is grown so brown and coarse	23.131486273054836
Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again	68.6276927596514
However little Mr	106.46642539687838
Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer	105.16972440045787
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her	79.20383070290691
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome	104.79800976259463
Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines	210.2405681922256
Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them	161.47179746593324
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable	73.58194769033771
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected	126.00260721991954
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
a beauty	180.64555287779592
--I should as soon call her mother a wit	95.8067550833209
But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time	201.94485357671107
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	104.95719121090008
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	84.35697581543656
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both	98.5885841554397
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	142.51513908157463
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs	100.17193073407209
Gardiner
thought of him, and Mrs	55.012823970390244
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject	39.29126078184181
CHAPTER IV	47.15195378156759
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere	151.96188624431088
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill	94.13284435176031
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves	113.05109802513346
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago	108.69652136056796
The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence	288.4171716618924
It was to this effect:

     "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well	126.52577690998895
What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia	73.31817568833888
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with Wickham	99.68060611492477
--Imagine our surprise	19.10522885665748
To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected	107.1352067236741
I am very, very sorry	29.940720137639612
So imprudent a
     match on both sides	68.85553068160668
--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood	53.93417829326039
Thoughtless and indiscreet I
     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
     marks nothing bad at heart	139.3373038076283
His choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing	101.4219333539772
Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved	51.41564580433377
My father bears it better	65.68422590739205
How thankful am I,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves	174.93302275112862
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight	447.80358224101883
The express was sent off directly	131.85175906191276
My dear Lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us	37.687468112879976
Colonel Forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon	87.34383832317151
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention	117.90164364982158
I must conclude, for I cannot be
     long from my poor mother	92.75952366539826
I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written	27.227989215419672
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	107.71953129557076
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
     for being coherent	87.30256272944867
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed	61.26748982238834
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr	51.53148237672051
Wickham and our poor Lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland	68.99238781643083
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express	129.33902284331566
Though Lydia's short
     letter to Mrs	72.02991580017309
F	1.0
gave them to understand that they were going to
     Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
     that W	108.04555533756928
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
     was repeated to Colonel F	111.33251775670946
who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from B	203.99296957637455
intending to trace their route	112.531678230438
He did trace them easily to
     Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from Epsom	196.77655083285282
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road	94.38311354140629
I know not what to think	62.24101601429056
After making
     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F	252.08299124711272
came on into
     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through	183.8562398777901
With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart	100.5325315594902
I am sincerely grieved for him and
     Mrs	37.381956426438514
F	1.0
but no one can throw any blame on them	127.59433227329468
Our distress, my
     dear Lizzy, is very great	23.017781927387297
My father and mother believe the worst,
     but I cannot think so ill of him	75.4942580590058
Many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can I suppose her so lost to every thing	111.34003102569184
--Impossible	1.0
I grieve to
     find, however, that Colonel F	135.88890271998187
is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared W	100.26952392398584
was not a man to be trusted	33.382958915351665
My poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room	117.1937870322002
Could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life
     saw him so affected	92.61332175676723
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder	147.29084172529335
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall I own that I long for your return	108.64370014889822
I am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient	90.73120954852745
Adieu	1.0
I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible	76.35774636400564
I know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
     still something more to ask of the former	65.96119303466908
My father is going to
     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her	84.05600708092008
What
     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
     to-morrow evening	57.48193520548761
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness	71.6719463634483
"Oh	1.0
where, where is my uncle	35.91344531510102
cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr	69.47454750368196
Darcy appeared	13.538093672611273
Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you	121.23472222680925
I must find Mr	57.614615488747155
Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; I have not an instant to lose	130.8389710664764
"Good God	37.78000710172101
what is the matter	19.37705189686004
cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr	194.35030755907147
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner	1.0
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself	46.35166599696148
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	79.32349350533458
Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly	194.44352863182098
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid	95.58308461693814
Is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief	110.89541562190118
--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one	91.13413457618704
--You are very
ill	27.586500274698725
"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself	97.9400733574371
"There
is nothing the matter with me	43.256229195772505
I am quite well	11.26732872996115
I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn	150.48147532037078
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word	86.41435455371804
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence	208.15616025153005
At length, she spoke again	39.43419273510821
"I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news	74.91766810001302
It cannot be concealed from any one	55.13402834521882
My
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of Mr	81.5377361447154
Wickham	1.0
They are gone off together
from Brighton	72.46625627171194
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest	83.3042294626271
She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever	125.07570590509133
Darcy was fixed in astonishment	83.9820273969399
"When I consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it	79.54083548978087
--_I_ who knew
what he was	51.43593760091402
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
I learnt, to my own family	113.58943884236
Had his character been known, this could not
have happened	84.89520219354348
But it is all, all too late now	58.08616080184977
"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked	24.01953813484
But is it
certain, absolutely certain	154.89420452154445
"Oh yes	4.891929890542565
--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland	168.8361299178253
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her	69.23334495130597
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour	101.19754992597561
But
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done	51.843545307796894
How is
such a man to be worked on	31.604060276093314
How are they even to be discovered	170.12115292477867
I have
not the smallest hope	28.87162892194786
It is every way horrible	48.34489107829564
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	62.412038629418475
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character	77.63771800810594
--Oh	1.0
had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do	89.46742365531219
But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much	29.248130660042843
Wretched, wretched, mistake	56.70550774864855
Darcy made no answer	31.314103452811626
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy	102.20959462091571
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it	79.63655425683997
Her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	210.29969404502654
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress	76.52896222990044
It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain	117.85449636463811
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her	45.1169473189997
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern	145.20728921260397
Would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress	169.50810355003225
--But I will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	124.34225251649936
This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day	205.85999888645898
"Oh, yes	4.891929890542565
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy	43.86201080004492
Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately	126.34583021444917
Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible	58.55802758978476
--I know it cannot be long	28.93595715841313
He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away	197.58843853414157
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination	100.08424427537042
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	196.83611002052623
But if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment	134.05758105863305
Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business	181.2782356875824
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her	145.42568106192363
No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation	71.06353257179637
Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement	58.51455265561725
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible	108.20971348816569
But now it was all too natural	46.85881744004787
For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey	135.43302846174095
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	128.83050387740167
Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion	225.14585990788464
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object	114.28696608954229
The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	168.8149428125462
--Oh	1.0
how acutely did she now
feel it	167.9879711223912
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe	123.65644402826834
Mr	1.0
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy	144.96272580237522
--Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr	60.82179541518091
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected	73.49901396750417
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr	137.5366241844083
Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power	175.29560447156553
--Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled	146.40903886975553
They were to be off as soon as possible	28.45439780781874
"But what is to be
done about Pemberley	45.72118681373287
cried Mrs	4.666307015188249
Gardiner	1.0
"John told us Mr	86.9073500405258
Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so	64.9801854749171
"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	47.44826487578433
_That_ is all settled	22.276946701839094
"That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare	84.27483908915708
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth	133.39599728603247
Oh, that I knew how it was	25.933504882106696
But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour	233.94413848552713
Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure	100.09477391129872
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr	69.88017056638725
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn	89.27212280784958
CHAPTER V	44.91202906605083
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter	137.38081812060415
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best	78.12726222663171
Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward	91.1915838858741
Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster	102.31471831416457
His temptation is
not adequate to the risk	50.506895097389425
"Do you really think so	51.643654383056244
cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment	18.791557046670636
"Upon my word," said Mrs	36.5083221801284
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion	67.40800306734052
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it	123.69824439364507
I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham	41.48683721848233
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it	68.24650005953266
"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest	216.14265942058088
But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable	61.416618216868436
If, indeed, it should be so	28.05858912894906
But I dare not
hope it	68.35583342593813
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
case	103.92668852552501
"In the first place," replied Mr	41.753153172201145
Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland	63.16565291491896
"Oh	1.0
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption	86.3822647711942
And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road	52.00909045062798
"Well, then--supposing them to be in London	23.9080103969704
They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose	96.40940501929168
It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland	94.6860671523217
"But why all this secrecy	71.87279715781646
Why any fear of detection	182.8366920982709
Why must their
marriage be private	270.80096938150706
Oh	1.0
no, no, this is not likely	58.176970081712035
His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her	117.39530615093838
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money	81.17439851550782
He
cannot afford it	20.077775637402702
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well	223.51528734092338
As to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	99.72321539473248
But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good	63.89319148197118
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter	99.49209972687811
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	69.77432102111487
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt	98.61546443549152
But, really, I know not what to say	85.02648720940394
Perhaps I am not doing her justice	39.13001284885059
But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity	164.64519325649044
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	86.57410656611441
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head	88.60088895292145
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it	49.63674046700322
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough	71.54231803259941
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman	78.86446599000004
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt	57.91167298120581
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill	253.28873628618675
And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them	155.00430822509145
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is	49.66142445136941
We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word	46.33810781204048
That he has neither integrity nor honour	58.805408490792296
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating	59.57503009833696
"And do you really know all this	51.741662486852505
cried Mrs	4.666307015188249
Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	66.20213583991611
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring	34.197815005802646
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr	97.72585906504183
Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him	107.66820410577213
And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless	113.55442547728592
From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl	73.69317155137789
Yet he knew to the contrary himself	71.81640386948835
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her	58.09158524431511
"But does Lydia know nothing of this	161.113552909805
Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand	72.54420126058416
"Oh, yes	4.891929890542565
--that, that is the worst of all	57.54896183458233
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr	67.73438604642979
Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself	96.52851176014634
And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time	255.73485306578704
As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown	155.4756773333217
And even when it
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs	132.09500052264724
Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	117.81946589388578
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	50.223899864878845
That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts	113.61012991898578
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other	79.04184924601086
"Not the slightest	58.51649210591753
I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away	59.54655820693718
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were	94.53640082178839
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites	160.06405384951844
*       *       *       *       *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey	93.5609529594867
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent	86.44966081994987
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness	108.82510751192282
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day	103.60554123487195
It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations	48.962709167717954
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	111.82758506064673
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her	168.43637773748173
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives	161.4075934963162
"Not yet," replied Jane	37.565848700353314
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
every thing will be well	78.92586226081889
"Is my father in town	34.23221515496824
"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word	90.68395769555093
"And have you heard from him often	88.62951755688535
"We have heard only once	43.78863837726038
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do	76.5956015399497
He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention	103.61896691862573
"And my mother--How is she	60.49202954159875
How are you all	35.101923653118966
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken	99.50050877941052
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all	63.47862507913921
She does not yet leave her dressing-room	46.59767009215003
Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven	18.784172927412275
are quite well	16.718642828198096
"But you--How are you	22.164559146934195
cried Elizabeth	2.634894999603702
"You look pale	63.52208277462665
How much you
must have gone through	24.347661047203925
Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr	77.77721782692642
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party	61.110156725816836
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears	77.76013879214648
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give	70.61941368306543
The sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage	284.30467583842284
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing	188.67625822391864
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her	95.05521891036751
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight	225.66764026835284
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after	89.92705826288822
I always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am	74.01706427751743
Poor dear
child	25.860262379821396
And now here's Mr	44.80436865052426
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all	87.82728793333357
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do	92.69421855197194
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr	79.10504114171006
Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr	88.41559669505612
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia	275.6624169735402
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain	81.82836175053572
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton	72.4113357752752
In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost	104.68544133063516
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done	66.85026312441424
"Oh	1.0
my dear brother," replied Mrs	51.622598457432034
Bennet, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for	32.807999390330146
And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry	108.46630407439862
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married	156.24108261994772
And, above all things, keep Mr	90.46827812554038
Bennet from
fighting	14.742441332816655
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day	111.86354867889081
And tell my dear
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses	139.0779069059768
Oh, brother,
how kind you are	68.34137725397028
I know you will contrive it all	42.549795151119326
But Mr	11.575292088471809
Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters	109.39133559058769
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject	106.4675010302983
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before	84.72677166860088
One came from her books, and the other from her
toilette	74.42043483352396
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty	166.27210667633273
As
for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of	134.84305723241442
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation	73.45279189157847
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	132.65325545025942
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply	32.55401905690185
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	141.77851739889618
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy	76.60726697613612
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which
I have not already heard	101.66768916483507
Give me farther particulars	15.111011408850192
What did Colonel
Forster say	80.61445970929294
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place	138.9799497835732
They must have seen them together for ever	49.13496675006394
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm	147.80693386147442
I am so
grieved for him	34.14652254388813
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost	104.53923839552353
He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey	133.88595031930262
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry	98.63624302391604
Did he know of
their intending to go off	105.84660894583007
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself	229.92180420115952
"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it	103.12978786896753
He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before	60.84904860785473
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married	95.93928837336325
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains	109.35354991967931
I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right	94.85136397484303
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be	122.5194699365914
Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step	115.15206848925935
She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks	49.435560034853225
"But not before they went to Brighton	46.240594774085615
"No, I believe not	64.25472008000845
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself	93.22219031819624
Does he
know his real character	158.68908644182886
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did	82.28592913723521
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	61.32233405971176
And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in
debt; but I hope this may be false	138.60153801604793
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened	108.88385180290523
"Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister	22.56180157213751
"But to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable	150.88619705929506
We acted with the best intentions	130.9697101656163
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife	53.78911317889014
"He brought it with him for us to see	82.39497400947128
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth	53.57649056661595
These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed	82.99707539511608
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world I love, and he is an angel	74.43749120849822
I should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off	114.39111276250357
You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
     Wickham	113.74141426721594
What a good joke it will be	27.462259194573807
I can hardly write for
     laughing	41.67822106858567
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night	117.39408558552435
Tell him I hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure	61.11006530949848
I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up	104.74033487052165
Good bye	14.047654827744326
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
     will drink to our good journey	72.86233566218293
"Your affectionate friend,

     "LYDIA BENNET	104.38193598853185
"Oh	1.0
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia	6.166839209304496
cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it	20.625157454701093
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment	58.56893736117393
But
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey	54.65202516223635
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy	113.85042091673695
My poor father	75.25015779448171
how he must have felt it	31.41618568453571
"I never saw any one so shocked	75.2198201574512
He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes	67.6831935336663
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion	120.99385301882019
"Oh	1.0
Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day	66.0921588984225
"I do not know	8.97300545081235
--I hope there was	13.143100233822182
--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult	52.52628764417951
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done	48.76796040130771
But the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties	252.10648243692518
"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you	36.34464019757883
You do not look
well	40.57483830409741
Oh	1.0
that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone	99.54322346121374
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them	60.538663718110676
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on	219.21757454801605
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me	89.34949491292907
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us	96.8396623437618
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours	97.71884724147209
Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable	28.097713301455848
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied	157.93026996726599
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter	90.49767348721655
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them	118.78140824099675
His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham	78.57295541813805
It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham	104.38566982980433
If he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach	162.42565035600273
I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this	61.03031984284575
CHAPTER VI	43.529276357152554
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr	38.49792838609902
Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	100.10584237041427
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion	121.30940029590235
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain	62.74781480099314
Mr	1.0
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	100.30238162919498
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr	90.97487884577455
Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel	122.20108971853608
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces	81.71757343068703
She shared in their attendance on Mrs	418.17946367445467
Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom	65.20636573537499
Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them	121.4189512207516
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light	76.22093733650817
He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family	78.29165973071528
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness	37.62299202293908
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them	119.0799955309645
Mr	1.0
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street	131.56381087703505
That Mr	11.803878345417596
Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr	86.4324905878133
Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings	91.28060784780176
Mr	1.0
Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it	117.84351695515943
He added, that Mr	45.37330805196578
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon	92.39338453798688
There was also a postscript to this
effect	60.54789630484097
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	93.08035443874782
If there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence	84.30570946865863
At present we
have nothing to guide us	148.37612023836536
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	88.08976812406836
But, on second thoughts,
perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person	124.0889623489445
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved	142.57184089487112
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years	137.8674357848008
It was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to	71.22326081160942
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected	93.76197278021063
The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience	142.9793716352154
Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	240.02147440644214
But before they heard again from Mr	101.89432404776046
Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr	140.08813752052268
Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise	140.71551245413684
It was as
follows:

     "MY DEAR SIR,

     "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from Hertfordshire	106.22952491500475
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs	56.605526546046875
Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	131.29783578348994
No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind	156.48317093663735
The death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	45.79752751730804
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs	69.9010492519594
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age	71.58176708476871
Howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
     by Mrs	134.51794170465533
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,
     to whom I have related the affair	108.89519828566573
They agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family	100.5716697597479
And this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace	134.32617783414898
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence	91.38359111375101
"I am, dear Sir, &c	47.8718550585275
&c	1.0
Mr	1.0
Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	51.169620699886515
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living	94.04966176321969
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them	77.17377132895116
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him	75.6834543808118
And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount	114.46172267049548
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton	61.27868947057545
He owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable	97.37366626335681
Mr	1.0
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror	128.99020268561057
"A gamester	3.1134261932625242
she cried	12.618412199228171
"This is
wholly unexpected	55.46167419927115
I had not an idea of it	29.93733373875991
Mr	1.0
Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday	88.4601557379556
Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit	188.76479397374413
When Mrs	18.4162252559917
Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before	95.28066622678008
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia	114.69301466148168
she cried	12.618412199228171
"Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them	74.28088499881018
Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away	116.96687993217924
As Mrs	23.704582146513143
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr	54.65218764000721
Bennet
came from it	45.69268771966015
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn	137.528402574499
Mrs	1.0
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world	160.14045060004102
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs	65.57832125160715
Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing	57.96160326473844
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley	88.69944104230663
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better	105.71890779841951
It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two	77.56339645578375
When Mr	7.590193850603917
Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure	75.23935473176847
He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it	63.98956122280011
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
nothing of that	85.78462016646735
Who should suffer but myself	103.95851738835204
It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it	63.51080187429713
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth	53.33971784536489
"You may well warn me against such an evil	55.81293138966375
Human nature is so prone to
fall into it	67.02073962406764
No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame	94.39637533640929
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	36.0676505797573
It will pass away soon enough	71.16942002117125
"Do you suppose them to be in London	47.06342943020156
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed	145.8356773027503
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty	129.50651043190274
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration	139.60651943436446
Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind	222.37692429323056
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea	52.43861665594317
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune	256.03902048561827
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away	118.78157182184904
"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia	91.47629250621961
"_You_ go to Brighton	43.31808070350786
--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
for fifty pounds	59.98462062228369
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it	83.51644666140841
No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village	330.2054490138135
Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters	57.14303224381837
And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner	47.18498871164065
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry	158.51490541397243
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy	50.73784069771827
If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them	76.47652444806603
CHAPTER VII	54.98634585633872
Two days after Mr	51.23888863233624
Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask	132.37145208730823
"What do you mean, Hill	73.36804173259563
We have heard nothing from town	66.57096345490558
"Dear madam," cried Mrs	17.76396888192642
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr	166.92605587336692
Gardiner	1.0
He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter	145.15551005592607
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech	166.76181978764814
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse	80.60337475570942
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	111.37606301292467
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"Oh, Papa, what news	94.02657030042857
what news	33.52310253666699
have you heard from my uncle	48.561544547443965
"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express	53.78961073696962
"Well, and what news does it bring	103.33771499470997
good or bad	34.47220752582534
"What is there of good to be expected	76.30924723264751
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it	114.94023961812482
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	67.54266222748439
Jane now came up	70.60526868036459
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about	227.89202656076995
"Gracechurch-street, Monday,

     August 2	284.59971297562663
"MY DEAR BROTHER,

     "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction	65.43597046739298
Soon after
     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of London they were	113.36478995028958
The particulars, I reserve till we meet	167.0424902909621
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
     both----"

"Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married	116.28382542101514
Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both	46.7170589659611
They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are	72.31074957670228
All that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum	132.5773040592889
These are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as I thought myself privileged, for you	99.32337054004039
I shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	156.8211851563142
You
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr	165.505633777754
Wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be	58.75552606554605
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune	103.31042888873925
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement	149.80105229284112
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care	97.59977667012049
Send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly	76.12591174289382
We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve	79.04182368584908
She comes to us to-day	95.39827130570049
I shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on	53.670196840132796
Your's, &c	1.042784185590511
"EDW	1.0
GARDINER	1.0
"Is it possible	35.45509880775318
cried Elizabeth, when she had finished	18.30497836338217
"Can it be
possible that he will marry her	71.83851514514839
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister	154.47108215829905
"My dear father, I congratulate you	36.77012385907819
"And have you answered the letter	76.50379854127449
said Elizabeth	3.699587899331731
"No; but it must be done soon	79.8649691678159
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote	84.56755884212166
"Oh	1.0
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately	127.63479017658013
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case	84.85021617460339
"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself	50.74447015974918
"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done	95.9830863643986
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house	74.87495524410015
"And may I ask	136.17117262262747
said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with	31.493954621397588
"Complied with	1.1339582389020355
I am only ashamed of his asking so little	129.0910296579657
"And they _must_ marry	66.46417079308773
Yet he is _such_ a man	20.02949696289298
"Yes, yes, they must marry	345.360131264908
There is nothing else to be done	12.780958169541
But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am
ever to pay him	104.96822667065393
"Money	1.0
my uncle	7.441978735209864
cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir	80.29238618447789
"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone	175.12589712067845
"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before	44.20832283073366
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain	159.33501324708465
Oh	1.0
it must be my uncle's doings	43.604261546317424
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself	52.64738433914332
A small sum could not do all this	60.899712556798654
"No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds	68.16221095533886
I should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship	37.68398789136318
"Ten thousand pounds	5.625249694271537
Heaven forbid	7.703227592498684
How is half such a sum to be
repaid	54.56472794328504
Mr	1.0
Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house	136.48313617535234
Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room	63.84853218537154
"And they are really to be married	42.99341858447834
cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves	28.568430866721375
"How strange this is	27.473507250756082
And for _this_ we are to be
thankful	58.98290137031065
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice	158.90962632031776
Oh, Lydia	56.60128011294254
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her	101.28117091593381
Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced	108.76167329348506
He has
children of his own, and may have more	57.56764781550767
How could he spare half ten
thousand pounds	116.71408927326257
"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr	114.12482858749141
Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own	47.53365567222732
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited	50.953158508706125
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	294.58771506421067
By this time she is
actually with them	63.52492795220581
If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy	134.29235911919258
What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt	92.50738707681653
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy	88.81737723259121
His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking	69.2200495142843
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten	374.37146515568384
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget	217.43839337056397
It is useless to talk of it	26.27443084593553
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened	68.95350124123637
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her	58.828223404940445
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"Just as you please	88.915169137582
"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her	51.154684338966035
"Take whatever you like, and get away	83.58032341442635
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together	66.0780158261259
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs	52.30172152173335
Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all	144.84219360938368
After a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud	72.60214355043281
Mrs	1.0
Bennet could hardly
contain herself	61.66271253843227
As soon as Jane had read Mr	47.86805806669777
Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance	116.21334411139097
She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	80.82101095924347
To know
that her daughter would be married was enough	60.536916047884354
She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	102.67617967493615
"My dear, dear Lydia	16.664801458440913
she cried: "This is delightful indeed	64.33848141233699
--She will
be married	13.150624555177123
--I shall see her again	29.938933493599983
--She will be married at sixteen	30.504515138481622
--My
good, kind brother	38.06380625098721
--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
every thing	64.07237247230147
How I long to see her	42.73570481968111
and to see dear Wickham too	66.13176822911981
But the
clothes, the wedding clothes	171.27117335447457
I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly	212.48963956620065
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her	71.57554397510401
Stay, stay, I will go myself	90.8560895825663
Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill	77.29897944616017
I will put on my things in a moment	77.73780129702583
My dear, dear
Lydia	16.664801458440913
--How merry we shall be together when we meet	64.37700769988038
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr	114.61144164401851
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under	141.3371608788725
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness	71.63416533427316
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist Mr	48.66764939139139
Wickham with money	79.6045948178815
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle	100.2343533348457
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents	81.20848139362491
Well	1.0
I am so happy	16.838274632003323
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married	38.09834763806378
Mrs	1.0
Wickham	1.0
How well
it sounds	31.907494839377275
And she was only sixteen last June	333.4410546688002
My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me	61.497277762956145
We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately	135.43648525186214
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted	108.75954037208287
One day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual	117.93750527397059
Other schemes too came into her head	101.25987835447428
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips	76.83272486217867
And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs	64.58281585503609
Long	1.0
Kitty, run down and order the carriage	89.86714869624801
An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure	29.678187817225663
Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton	45.70627438742426
Oh	1.0
here comes Hill	51.97466100280073
My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news	91.41629342392528
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding	52.12559825678035
Mrs	1.0
Hill began instantly to express her joy	264.77819255337124
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom	63.48636808910083
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful	104.60374717579535
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained	142.61479922243927
CHAPTER VIII	40.271554161662635
Mr	1.0
Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him	103.65574801433993
He now wished it more than ever	71.87823256438219
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her	167.1704755765889
The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place	115.22366967422501
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	122.12759607384825
When first Mr	50.36321409069017
Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son	89.70495858202791
This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for	140.58480259416805
Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs	65.01449573688399
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would	55.76742706944569
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving	110.28755911834782
Mrs	1.0
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income	98.17287810654369
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs	52.671247449437224
Bennet and
the children	29.55912372516347
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents	135.91375879382227
This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr	101.73966278488959
Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him	48.29780163615386
In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him	142.4872112004213
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement	101.36654044173008
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum	113.25796661997644
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible	129.5523203848944
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence	209.04865506450568
His letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution	133.4662818981279
He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her	68.87189645879435
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood	57.88793483238722
It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy	59.17806643494729
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house	107.22676983384882
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain	136.3467645782159
It was a fortnight since Mrs	44.231410547370096
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high	98.22424877780591
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph	89.58260050120977
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants	124.01870873503316
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance	164.22360121811116
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off	189.45414411214213
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful	84.43969116712765
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained	81.24310994247249
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs	58.24894140063545
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding	115.06358165025797
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance	111.57686254258329
I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn	76.26800255069368
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr	488.3962140794707
Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs	91.57908435586019
Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter	102.1865958928936
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion	144.2951628861662
Mrs	1.0
Bennet could hardly comprehend
it	47.72444672249819
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible	128.76957118829506
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they
took place	126.38745156130949
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr	79.94376059401225
Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot	146.15522681591085
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means	62.66472190634179
There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much	78.45582652670562
Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them	96.39777490526454
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr	64.64846161060181
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	105.30980029172821
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	38.027585197364814
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this	98.29759726102769
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what	56.02690444265644
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it	66.5041100884991
She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	155.23317452359862
She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet	46.057664250805
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received	130.40588530716113
He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex	103.66193193532861
But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph	75.08614360996681
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her	155.605821316922
His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes	67.76305309731521
It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance	83.96464831458114
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was	306.19561097166644
An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family	58.70034165339709
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine	90.68211038369462
But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture	194.16257959302536
*       *       *       *       *

Mr	1.0
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	98.99186041421588
To Mr	15.977427655529677
Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	71.30659658120152
The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr	59.620369969007385
Wickham had resolved
on quitting the Militia	136.0556598584903
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on	71.31714254079547
And I think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's	151.87405222128976
It is Mr	18.19831373727552
Wickham's intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	175.3377881006061
He has the
     promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the North	71.13356392622586
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom	40.71121120451167
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent	180.8782939086566
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of Mr	57.54219942427774
Wickham in and near Brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself	143.99525679200207
And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information	86.4153291660656
He has given in all his debts; I hope
     at least he has not deceived us	65.96728691405768
Haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week	58.79160641720666
They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs	108.61179687257972
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the South	56.108098268205275
She is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother	44.69702968207953
--Your's, &c	1.042784185590511
"E	1.0
GARDINER	1.0
Mr	1.0
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr	154.94119132543602
Gardiner could do	16.12763676890527
But Mrs	16.86162275813253
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it	20.561837187661954
Lydia's being settled in the
North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites	78.98375736277528
"She is so fond of Mrs	29.490145088364763
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away	149.02485974801448
And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much	64.79243730516998
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment	142.2736364475692
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative	112.50211530567377
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished	77.27645724443254
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North	67.72792300953151
When Mr	7.590193850603917
Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn	104.4647711331232
Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes	107.48880111709697
CHAPTER IX	39.68442416583136
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself	86.20199134110366
The carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time	55.56280951929306
Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure	107.58260119217725
They came	20.32107716573455
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them	50.503402200219796
Smiles decked the face of Mrs	50.06883366870856
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy	57.361651687798194
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room	77.01298045367531
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	118.50471307541979
Their reception from Mr	83.88758179208254
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial	77.1399025628718
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips	84.98211277993087
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him	62.15084496359161
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked	64.47770512321583
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless	49.25617784538379
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there	111.01678418276272
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all	98.11497759360877
Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man	109.22612342942074
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour	138.21056973648797
There was no want of discourse	49.20054833803076
The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies	141.11842499288161
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world	121.86486834371071
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world	138.70630199120842
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time	118.29674827905292
Good gracious	5.9547309865505715
when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again	35.219075273301655
though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was	46.20668560257982
Her father lifted up his eyes	29.577338180663823
Jane was distressed	20.66544878047432
Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh	126.79089395625665
mamma, do the
people here abouts know I am married to-day	162.08184697649708
I was afraid they might
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing	125.36500828243314
Elizabeth could bear it no longer	38.618491854817
She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour	69.30937623592207
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "Ah	145.0069871146672
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman	125.9908633397409
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first	65.33960827714871
Her ease and good
spirits increased	93.62252725379308
She longed to see Mrs	20.602778467337767
Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs	65.53312100063114
Wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs	110.89292674942747
Hill and the two housemaids	17.082705379213817
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband	44.99651341811549
Is not he a charming man	90.13057326424014
I
am sure my sisters must all envy me	48.347915072588975
I only hope they may have half my
good luck	137.65479474780187
They must all go to Brighton	54.053994780463185
That is the place to get
husbands	26.47216538196535
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go	82.2319637749583
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should	88.98886938945967
But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off	80.83816324202502
Must it be so	22.69568214033331
"Oh, lord	2.177797879698185
yes;--there is nothing in that	44.05001115801873
I shall like it of all
things	44.7792754401253
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us	118.5882737096139
We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all	53.646065949971664
"I should like it beyond any thing	39.411578587473734
said her mother	12.728087386212621
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over	85.75742443387412
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands	66.32965204081982
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	79.44662526176313
Mr	1.0
Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight	62.10720580036897
No one but Mrs	45.47468164056114
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home	107.94777383801657
These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not	238.9569809731498
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia's for him	84.73256200253078
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion	99.02413381402967
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him	19.36046876116897
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him	89.81987484896153
He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country	50.37337932522498
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,

"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe	101.44737443998135
You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it	109.49566577638512
Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed	51.89388261229009
"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject	75.49679066751015
"La	1.0
You are so strange	32.97423037702658
But I must tell you how it went off	46.48656597397554
We were
married, you know, at St	66.8622601789757
Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish	126.69500600780566
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock	111.92972226744266
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church	50.07675101354126
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss	41.8055343278092
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted	118.01127156135318
And there was my
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon	65.07469116003219
However, I did not hear above one word in ten,
for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham	85.46400836778362
I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat	49.32901271801006
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them	76.62420129123718
If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight	99.36302475580406
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing	49.2206243209781
To be sure London was
rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open	118.87001928026807
Well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man Mr	79.77765884967532
Stone	1.0
And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it	97.87077894007977
Well, I was so frightened I did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day	80.04866910472879
But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out	89.3597535846421
However, I
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr	114.94874508782169
Darcy might have done as well	26.06400175244584
"Mr	1.0
Darcy	1.0
repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement	108.15637341064806
"Oh, yes	4.891929890542565
--he was to come there with Wickham, you know	70.10551697606614
But gracious me	382.77856237274415
I quite forgot	115.17162321306344
I ought not to have said a word about it	36.939839499764176
I promised
them so faithfully	62.07622352399566
What will Wickham say	104.61532389266553
It was to be such a secret	26.561227815068797
"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject	86.5556364005025
You may depend upon my seeking no further	84.99202571372307
"Oh	1.0
certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions	101.58068543169229
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry	89.27246954723694
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away	61.294054201015946
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information	88.72815863689263
Mr	1.0
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding	37.66637615883599
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go	175.38835376546902
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none	67.84328527041254
Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable	117.03629937613586
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended	89.05838463807906
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time	81.91322401219978
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance	99.26185248168163
"Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out	51.803323173523715
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante	136.9143593638325
CHAPTER X	36.142694885019736
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could	63.80689029444858
She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial	82.24510601488961
"Gracechurch-street, Sept	3.848352076339878
6	1.0
"MY DEAR NIECE,

     "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what I have to tell you	92.87844394681922
I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_	93.33276357599735
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side	142.11815232510958
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence	45.181093050108714
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done	88.17857472283319
But if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, I must be more explicit	48.65824366106187
On the very day of my coming
     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	125.4135954718013
Mr	1.0
Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours	124.09666755643012
It was all
     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been	117.43451345663823
He came to tell Mr	19.455736511590942
Gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and Mr	59.702092750087445
Wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
     once	155.16452467402203
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them	86.72843915475595
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him	82.7552967944196
He generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world	156.86413678691633
His character
     was to speak for itself	71.04552281659477
He called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself	130.50463563869548
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
     disgrace him	44.16036262407612
He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us	87.78026593276962
There is a lady, it seems, a
     Mrs	51.10652088158775
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what	91.06070578711595
She then took a large house in Edward-street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings	81.84730628939003
This Mrs	117.1580103501095
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town	71.2795486123805
But
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted	54.37227156847621
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found	99.01184993901234
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her	97.19250996048058
At length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction	212.56461931168428
They were in ----
     street	14.71574255097226
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia	100.19712523685973
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go	93.1878951323048
But he found Lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	111.19646439709389
She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham	97.87768221735438
She was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when	37.94507446752599
Since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design	173.08046189393724
He confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone	116.74541384224392
He
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it	134.90159515323467
He must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on	47.124183283755286
Mr	1.0
Darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once	81.2962636812552
Though Mr	9.47128371789777
Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage	49.25581818500829
But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country	116.72585698712149
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief	136.07718049383305
They met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed	85.94337083787512
Wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable	44.99721629087299
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr	40.171320622015806
Darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home	108.99165788786543
But Mr	11.575292088471809
Gardiner
     could not be seen, and Mr	26.08851655814386
Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning	143.5836588294922
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former	100.6585347651393
He did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business	96.10477259012926
On Saturday he came again	46.57304956397187
Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together	71.53910079984774
They met again on Sunday, and
     then _I_ saw him too	82.64956476066666
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon
     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn	52.7937331677113
But our visitor
     was very obstinate	63.41459448914517
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all	133.95064246697387
He has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one	101.65352206193066
Nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole	78.85146237993033
They battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved	136.3159328284406
But at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due	120.57469810747044
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or Jane at most	147.01301917934632
You know pretty well, I suppose,
     what has been done for the young people	72.07244940685692
His debts are to be paid,
     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased	132.407591615987
The reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as I have given above	76.97961605542145
It was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was	75.01642559059016
Perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event	140.26758647917964
But in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair	94.15394674042734
When all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish	86.56463677299402
I believe I have now told you every thing	39.94434072577562
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	79.89272436681557
Lydia came to
     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house	59.98413068682939
_He_ was
     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain	88.4984243206817
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	74.72099990091976
If she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen	46.62920499130944
I was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her	182.8641754860055
Mr	1.0
Darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding	97.13556991750302
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on Wednesday or Thursday	179.47397239511156
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him	76.9709650828285
His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire	176.4501910186239
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him	136.64261272809838
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name	74.16416073358705
But slyness seems the fashion	99.8299872039351
Pray forgive
     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from P	69.6317409697037
I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park	47.81923573374218
A low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing	87.5531871479154
But I must write no more	25.601434959471383
The children have been wanting me this half hour	187.0997555179263
Your's, very
     sincerely,

     "M	73.78062047043325
GARDINER	1.0
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share	351.30610928832306
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr	55.164794711362624
Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	129.0772482087796
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	110.66622332617536
He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	80.84480286364989
Her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her	108.31623397133768
But it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham	123.06510019791826
Brother-in-law of Wickham	15.923294150578563
Every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection	98.35739437002536
He had to be sure done much	54.709681288888895
She was ashamed to think how
much	27.06827659032094
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief	88.34989424561775
It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned	96.91167248730572
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return	52.770165521202536
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
to him	81.80367287300396
Oh	1.0
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him	143.62035086570768
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him	59.196365181838196
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself	52.48466545740336
She read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again	79.51341829435732
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her	91.02645212917359
She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between Mr	236.00648024997852
Darcy and herself	21.215333570536707
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham	63.98171669272968
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister	63.31741449126779
said he,
as he joined her	38.831199553195646
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome	82.94219867426331
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were	39.814283477571
_We_ were always good friends;
and now we are better	80.11012943286636
"True	1.0
Are the others coming out	35.23599963856812
"I do not know	8.97300545081235
Mrs	1.0
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton	62.29558414991789
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley	85.78149030158312
She replied in the affirmative	59.82748440993814
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle	81.08287845310876
And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose	62.138902616440355
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me	44.32517740992125
But of course she did not mention my name to you	43.28521752650189
"Yes, she did	14.417467518384678
"And what did she say	85.99715368857902
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well	63.03035635298149
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented	81.07194223989168
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips	43.28741123948319
Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month	63.51078113740656
We passed each other
several times	21.186744886253557
I wonder what he can be doing there	55.47009984390929
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth	74.8647528428062
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year	121.85242245977439
"Undoubtedly	1.0
Did you see him while you were at Lambton	62.314551341515546
I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had	48.24613006925329
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister	51.401069835139516
"And do you like her	36.4323391257916
"Very much	5.277579597701709
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two	45.57519124881955
When I last saw her, she was not very promising	82.4750787503345
I am very glad
you liked her	33.64771480760849
I hope she will turn out well	77.82676993715005
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age	110.66476176972319
"Did you go by the village of Kympton	26.92407056763876
"I do not recollect that we did	45.25496143531244
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had	75.3766566563664
A
most delightful place	38.662940852163956
--Excellent Parsonage House	35.880566206060465
It would have suited
me in every respect	53.27396051748329
"How should you have liked making sermons	377.88384777577653
"Exceedingly well	9.758983050562376
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing	63.600092808887226
One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me	36.37941622110829
The
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness	73.12393981711722
But it was not to be	11.14577093712397
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent	91.70651461051837
"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron	108.3953603346767
"You have	5.669828220021814
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember	69.92611894968721
"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly	74.60488841989266
"You did	10.935927836508611
and it was not wholly without foundation	52.1806776765866
You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it	58.91523800452023
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

"Come, Mr	78.0079890440678
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know	58.282087534654686
Do not let us
quarrel about the past	30.608769184678142
In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind	72.90032944713157
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house	78.46035762505186
CHAPTER XI	48.79236161531385
Mr	1.0
Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet	80.77701456836255
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs	156.9799002812762
Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth	87.61653362921521
"Oh	1.0
my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again	56.99048074267823
"Oh, lord	2.177797879698185
I don't know	49.860741265530486
Not these two or three years perhaps	47.37279562427188
"Write to me very often, my dear	31.263139561555718
"As often as I can	52.959767029626995
But you know married women have never much time for
writing	150.15478054311262
My sisters may write to _me_	42.1835233637593
They will have nothing else to
do	18.194345573172175
Mr	1.0
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's	83.13050212415985
He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things	354.74698600442116
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr	108.92110170575309
Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw	40.97470066549092
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all	39.16974652305799
I am prodigiously proud of him	25.48029503390935
I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law	140.46874614630838
The loss of her daughter made Mrs	43.083654188203305
Bennet very dull for several days	60.143080342868764
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends	210.37727810129556
One seems so forlorn without them	67.47684631441903
"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth	71.68513732584758
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single	187.91831315491748
"It is no such thing	111.88860795723009
Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off	79.90360427864306
If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon	51.015557344137
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation	110.24978280007994
The
housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks	93.25690928901712
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was quite in the fidgets	12.624915120297889
She
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns	72.26637342541235
"Well, well, and so Mr	48.183226926536356
Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs	129.05027033314508
Philips first brought her the news	119.32154184268823
"Well, so much the better	30.842949810181413
Not that
I care about it, though	70.21015631587753
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again	39.740327728669065
But, however, he is very welcome to
come to Netherfield, if he likes it	53.489600674049925
And who knows what _may_ happen	91.66865076064389
But that is nothing to us	41.38617424095278
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it	83.1045815016153
And so, is it quite certain he is coming	156.61052839430695
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs	74.96988583977797
Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true	96.3733828933346
He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday	139.3834518039223
She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed	95.8182711674354
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour	72.69864018293927
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed	87.81606710783072
But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause	72.94182420812828
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt
that I _should_ be looked at	101.60647504898184
I do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain	64.86351120012583
I am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him	87.56662783841568
Not that I am afraid
of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks	93.17100272194678
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it	37.260594312279686
Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it	97.90759836439007
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation	108.42990211061615
I _will_ leave him to himself	49.85961640425043
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it	68.51651561134847
They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them	56.29155935917383
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again	81.90615517155261
"As soon as ever Mr	40.01529602918311
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs	95.53431954277511
Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course	46.94505678475001
"No, no	18.27529561623664
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters	124.89495327114938
But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again	38.12019198266877
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield	104.58454165418489
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he	140.60162205155964
"If he wants our society, let
him seek it	75.51567663195094
He knows where we live	47.83963489909667
I will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again	115.58416986638015
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him	39.90232620860675
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined	128.14059213968162
We must have Mrs	32.82269397757257
Long and the Gouldings soon	90.18494306639845
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him	82.2689711618495
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr	74.5546809315499
Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did	61.31852941212513
As the day of his arrival drew near,

"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister	47.872771301488164
"It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	99.66013377525576
My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she
says	77.0490779056134
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over	142.36927674484392
"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power	75.70677939601059
You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much	83.91628870432017
Mr	1.0
Bingley arrived	29.356963352767522
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could	66.2745975959173
She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before	141.1650243235858
But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house	77.2552842304602
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	82.49214636196035
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr	65.82162371581268
Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister	31.361403337646365
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be	63.59949216759614
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know	32.72526882657868
"La	1.0
replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before	113.62601490110212
Mr	1.0
what's his name	29.025036224001408
That tall, proud man	186.88261270843088
"Good gracious	5.9547309865505715
Mr	1.0
Darcy	1.0
--and so it does I vow	61.84172299394511
Well, any friend of
Mr	52.35292425198667
Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him	96.93463253088525
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern	72.89700628703102
She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter	148.65798589924935
Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough	51.581229049337345
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr	64.78856164391802
Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr	54.432490445939386
Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them	74.18632772709158
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs	56.41606234196597
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	94.06692832386621
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley	80.07725754702426
Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire	134.42663676803147
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken	82.70892101833115
But she would not be secure	27.627276020227534
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation	180.72760871048777
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door	69.72322873530871
Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected	45.33822536715593
On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance	104.94427951748219
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command	78.04697917899213
She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy	141.67083925569764
He looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley	56.56532686740506
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	60.972998739164275
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture	46.051084234140596
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	113.74235383218308
He was received by Mrs	47.51455036627037
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend	71.1202048837586
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied	141.88906388599872
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr	152.30599618802339
and Mrs	12.460728037775995
Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing	108.26504194217274
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in Derbyshire	67.20200168628996
There he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself	38.17071375574532
But now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground	131.51517170518238
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed	145.66156943547702
She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so	89.71501633600722
"Could I expect it to be otherwise	78.74280765928002
said she	4.3269098540289095
"Yet why did he come	85.57854186562436
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak	62.35844963226959
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more	110.6648542326921
"It is a long time, Mr	37.20063605019727
Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs	33.55002748798331
Bennet	1.0
He readily agreed to it	65.49357674053839
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again	34.099181035194064
People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true	115.51356795066344
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away	38.7653851802974
Miss Lucas is married and settled	71.97251548941752
And one of my
own daughters	127.82385554374866
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers	41.62643323345522
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be	39.72942186785313
It was only said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq	47.1182855899207
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing	86.82077648682481
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it	130.16760040778874
Did you see it	27.816095004336006
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations	77.40586908769636
Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes	43.86788418640607
How Mr	11.234343673613266
Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell	38.21806549843336
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr	98.12262559538279
Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me	64.28878795539039
They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long	84.70106984445316
His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars	77.50356255102297
Thank Heaven	2.0153399676166845
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves	123.60192970006031
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr	56.56638497155791
Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat	66.86198178424762
It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present	82.1481911682481
A few weeks, he believed	35.206017338891655
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr	92.5251883256682
Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr	98.10579896896903
Bennet's manor	6.401218365399426
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you	32.48436751354401
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention	128.04969047761503
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	104.84264608010486
At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion	129.78539771657967
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them	109.46409031962015
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this	121.72597354177533
Let me never see either
one or the other again	81.03182614110513
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover	111.27188025716056
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	129.18959596793397
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty	95.0669637064012
Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever	80.93430151815238
But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent	42.76515795310323
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs	36.231441926518904
Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time	37.40446781460939
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr	73.38136792442187
Bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned	82.37321458478426
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement	52.07166052156348
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business	252.38623811268096
They then went away	19.171463739949157
Mrs	1.0
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year	94.91457584337908
CHAPTER XII	43.021281467720314
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more	135.79051218587588
Mr	1.0
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her	65.45067318183787
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all	77.00050554581608
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	119.22474201899261
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me	67.65316635555286
If he fears me, why come hither	226.42849763562495
If
he no longer cares for me, why silent	150.13498943561905
Teazing, teazing, man	92.56952843087875
I will
think no more about him	52.16250144700515
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth	146.2597106701704
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy	180.53456502190758
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming	63.33320957318778
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday	52.96855426111858
It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance	155.0271338868755
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly	77.9175256637956
"Oh, Jane,
take care	26.4967232049525
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now	55.66056130121484
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever	60.353321839172295
*       *       *       *       *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs	18.906861488449906
Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived	121.13572210502024
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time	81.78530843704478
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister	79.2011102866022
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself	96.66518740257875
On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided	134.30944789991233
He placed himself by her	78.17527517846592
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend	160.7332237640149
He
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr	75.4040229750223
Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm	28.35789737439354
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured	188.75063245376919
Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	79.91752123870249
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour	108.5242035532267
Mr	1.0
Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them	51.59568204912397
He was on one side of her mother	31.105014457901994
She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage	65.03996355676396
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did	112.7259170863407
Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family	80.16284696601454
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	81.44393133900232
Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil	77.6955553615181
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	61.678748356290455
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever	50.04029102079911
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas	67.7676353876841
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair	70.74828943731542
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined	163.1550354260709
We want none of them;
do we	86.3673525121725
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room	40.73640299739935
She followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly	67.58194128024043
"A man who has once been refused	88.66731537962832
How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love	60.482119728790245
Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	68.4454476687134
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings	65.55220233745348
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"Is your sister at Pemberley still	109.11461050758838
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas	132.30799652956085
"And quite alone	72.34317407018092
Have all her friends left her	38.162296653761175
"Mrs	1.0
Annesley is with her	31.907375556145663
The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks	54.20512015074364
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success	57.310655300004164
He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away	94.08485892177059
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party	55.99581670749511
She now lost every expectation of pleasure	74.75562441462105
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	70.35472887491285
Mrs	1.0
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them	127.45831532081276
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
say you to the day	64.30089959799362
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you	89.50276536205725
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw	74.81003893665415
The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch	50.794584274078794
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucas's last week; and even Mr	129.27661203488202
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least	44.843814655082305
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty	56.67256655123677
Mrs	1.0
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not	84.17824362897055
And
what do you think she said besides	55.771736230939
'Ah	1.0
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last	62.644542959956716
She did indeed	28.724923004890744
I do think Mrs	24.719841712544643
Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously	110.21206778538486
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals	112.1189330086049
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth	66.43384938843292
"The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other	108.26420474756662
I hope we
may often meet again	46.32187331855669
Elizabeth smiled	16.658745977631824
"Lizzy, you must not do so	16.088144187448048
You must not suspect me	28.229489801862798
It mortifies me	20.236625403515756
I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it	103.28561663227279
I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection	115.3644645607837
It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man	108.22220311592568
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment	107.85891771977654
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed	58.5080607445049
"And how impossible in others	61.896734171684
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge	78.74996183176322
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer	46.463432164757315
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	95.33848945081087
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante	79.70467671882086
CHAPTER XIII	50.811904919547814
A few days after this visit, Mr	57.57336068882418
Bingley called again, and alone	202.76348372943784
His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time	83.390418712328
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits	81.49487097900682
Mrs	1.0
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	127.98339371172669
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky	86.16309792061446
He should be particularly happy at any time, &c	46.813677269520795
&c	1.0
; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	55.27686526665584
"Can you come to-morrow	48.54907831515189
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity	86.94378563846618
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed	73.67292992187761
In ran Mrs	64.56791703541991
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down	93.93897580471683
He is come--Mr	5.60251395955276
Bingley is
come	33.13919550295229
--He is, indeed	25.3222770716639
Make haste, make haste	15.98544587212105
Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown	88.5818231196519
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair	134.60640331879367
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago	76.82581486316516
"Oh	1.0
hang Kitty	32.19761931190671
what has she to do with it	84.91604541978124
Come be quick, be quick	512.3586570229867
where is your sash my dear	19.55231029569787
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters	44.84632680142039
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening	68.24020606978823
After tea, Mr	59.18819086525754
Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument	84.43001160594007
Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs	70.1771818700255
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them	171.66096758023474
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma	121.92628447414226
What do
you keep winking at me for	61.897728122896915
What am I to do	71.74293414132246
"Nothing child, nothing	99.93499875913606
I did not wink at you	63.02269285066477
She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room	109.86510811324023
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it	69.66024078711494
In a few minutes, Mrs	19.529585646692574
Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you	65.68557520935217
Elizabeth was forced to go	15.16808149822086
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall	55.13138513944732
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room	60.64845916526711
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room	90.2689414560298
Mrs	1.0
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual	24.004413169139806
Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter	52.090783648351156
His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter	141.11762296638244
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs	101.97614479566573
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	41.44665581024069
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference	86.82418323981537
Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr	147.09261895596467
Darcy
returned within the stated time	160.45412817196214
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence	74.16427291910033
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr	48.27308246853668
Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on	140.22163000341794
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected	153.6637164573834
There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him	117.04706339253272
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs	38.20027459700573
Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter	62.83446033056061
Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes	56.35043940722207
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her	101.49789104888883
On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all	192.87479636384347
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse	179.198085536954
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room	71.3620202711915
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world	83.20292132877313
"'Tis too much	5.22783841677976
she added, "by far too much	41.995975196882185
I do not deserve it	24.03440235175631
Oh	1.0
why is not every body as happy	47.291551049652284
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express	241.42347011164472
Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane	55.885181455068995
But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present	56.10069147742671
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried	69.9969641205577
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself	77.1668190822032
He is gone to my father already	33.728395831168214
Oh	1.0
Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family	84.00048512837641
how shall I bear so much happiness	51.044984401502475
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty	33.077589847925324
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation	103.78855799304591
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection	67.07637406131694
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance	82.92326229894539
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end	248.95195886923122
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose	51.87167582107108
"Where is your sister	25.53839511745096
said he hastily, as he opened the door	33.48296113368905
"With my mother up stairs	55.278063363627695
She will be down in a moment I dare say	33.50764013798777
He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister	83.02086116776162
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship	114.19563296153142
They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself	88.84215427803548
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever	75.37735955905713
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon	119.27814122937095
Mrs	1.0
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr	70.79771426494976
Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was	146.59757742337567
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you	98.93038715449397
You will be a very happy woman	28.79982791294887
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness	54.33767968013156
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled	48.610964660434874
I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together	49.98579287879321
Your tempers are by no means unlike	56.708338355559235
You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income	114.35628535111783
"I hope not so	49.422305249805646
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_	159.52085965413377
"Exceed their income	33.460206247432
My dear Mr	13.246607175751276
Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of	103.98829758985116
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more	37.17751446325437
Then addressing her daughter, "Oh	51.9322532357162
my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy	24.074448541297183
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night	116.37894157518822
I knew how it
would be	22.335393704032438
I always said it must be so, at last	43.19194171273789
I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing	51.75365791284796
I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together	100.6636917542418
Oh	1.0
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen	54.1715255457401
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten	123.96494533927323
Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child	112.60239882151907
At that moment, she cared for no other	56.91172077774893
Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense	47.88094128268228
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	63.24504747983496
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept	133.35711463023307
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur	107.2187813716181
In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief	103.53480726869786
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring	102.14049812878952
I had not
believed it possible	42.57731817173923
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth	63.84012146926246
"But how did he account for
it	103.47116000709055
"It must have been his sister's doing	36.904202266826985
They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	76.33947319111773
But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other	109.40953870529768
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard you utter	85.58977602022907
Good girl	21.476246349165784
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard	76.41305029696615
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again	67.87723810851396
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty	49.63338524994775
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities	167.14975814646152
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him	74.31188590901476
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed	188.4778964034078
cried
Jane	5.495166822912573
"Oh	1.0
Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all	194.69730731068773
If I could but see _you_ as happy	100.6516996322552
If there _were_ but
such another man for you	95.16168065793279
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you	85.01949731269279
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness	118.90384604827756
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr	74.7950737647548
Collins in time	36.976562643998925
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret	81.277741551723
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs	59.32163977476872
Philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton	77.25856197911197
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	108.7884311262696
CHAPTER XIV	46.23386779260451
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn	106.01683853851647
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	77.44943657370688
The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them	121.77417735749852
As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery	70.1147081811237
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered	198.48853878976496
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh	8.60381948619921
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs	85.37215556615821
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt	142.7455948271417
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word	65.57047588505293
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made	72.49641154280202
Mrs	1.0
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness	84.99538953891
After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet	100.49657402581984
That lady I suppose is your mother	65.0145719686665
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	45.92452248010514
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters	53.304379615640975
"Yes, madam," said Mrs	84.86557992194221
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine	22.101850437320238
"She is my youngest girl but one	84.02544640441764
My youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who I believe will soon become a part of the family	89.7105542375467
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence	74.2070190961635
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's	54.19134456359055
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west	143.65462564569515
Mrs	1.0
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr	147.19666401098132
and
Mrs	12.460728037775995
Collins well	38.09410637440116
"Yes, very well	9.332659574756569
I saw them the night before last	185.37542059256515
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	265.48273210296577
But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled	49.22947249905372
Mrs	1.0
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn	99.05075984963555
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company	81.20594968267062
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks	113.3382572570168
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage	15.738699277920173
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs	85.26723157340702
As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on	78.89384607815182
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it	54.105985016744995
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable	87.93238682463499
"How could I ever think her like her nephew	114.23602227599669
said she, as she looked in
her face	39.99136739457152
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither	60.4923976911394
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come	338.5972346797448
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	132.9937606537284
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam	115.18093027446793
I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here	41.65825400070492
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with	40.103413467805225
But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so	71.32594518063286
My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it	110.88207323071336
A report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago	43.981953156230205
I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr	122.8351717026168
Darcy	1.0
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you	79.79533519254593
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far	59.977114385701896
What could your ladyship propose by it	138.56405124283478
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted	72.78880504608505
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence	110.7365297335607
"If	1.0
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it	29.229795767582544
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves	58.40770984342505
Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad	61.61279044508625
"I never heard that it was	18.685949465820958
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it	62.014672334972516
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	60.37001405756358
_You_
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer	46.32964067756944
"This is not to be borne	48.01047524213659
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied	35.239155543932625
Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage	84.56172563757713
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	65.58362396050016
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason	44.165389557218894
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	71.85538059745757
You
may have drawn him in	32.85241997952474
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it	46.555749106252705
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am	42.961733183539764
I have not been accustomed to such
language as this	97.22471950853716
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	51.55157546616144
"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit	135.1493946056253
"Let me be rightly understood	54.92635390803885
This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place	66.96761338920442
No, never	17.008218869382066
Mr	1.0
Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_	48.00721597227094
Now what have you to say	61.38948752670303
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me	59.43048666823006
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	72.04307254695236
From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other	65.52536999439107
It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's	80.77670451331065
While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family	85.14566096445154
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends	62.14487520080985
To his
tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh	33.21750653798251
Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy	145.49874901656653
Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin	182.86444051723294
"Yes, and I had heard it before	38.44689510837373
But what is that to me	56.05598278212745
If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss De Bourgh	69.92513041797552
You both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage	94.74924133651896
Its completion depended on others	61.6982685603557
If Mr	17.561859289137427
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice	271.74125431832243
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him	126.57737763457294
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it	3088.4171035863565
Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	61.57843112835724
You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him	45.613700459682846
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us	66.37359147861719
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth	47.034351662537226
"But the wife of Mr	73.10603956948555
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine	88.17722680041233
"Obstinate, headstrong girl	162.7941411339131
I am ashamed of you	14.587452012772685
Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring	72.29501177166718
Is nothing due to me on that
score	124.7280472920411
"Let us sit down	9.850188112352008
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
dissuaded from it	90.52246048295412
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims	84.46548546338964
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	29.0530091914407
"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_	68.03465392043051
"I will not be interrupted	24.996883955256326
Hear me in silence	41.32539444478191
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other	60.47598258183066
They are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families	122.00091065984849
Their fortune on both
sides is splendid	91.03758377073876
They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them	78.85491325107625
The
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune	201.5451957697765
Is this to be endured	63.25981632792215
But it must not, shall not be	17.164981857966286
If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up	86.43765969385478
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere	139.54618850954802
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal	72.23633630008304
"True	1.0
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter	22.221817788611393
But who was your mother	52.23316569003319
Who
are your uncles and aunts	155.30656871225014
Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition	84.9100710987752
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_	68.6283398319023
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him	45.92982873210989
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"I am not	80.80923653659022
Lady Catherine seemed pleased	8.62128383213795
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement	93.09566676733137
"I will make no promise of the kind	38.22533230951081
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished	27.508204145746895
I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman	51.56470927187163
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede	43.78196091701406
I shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance I require	58.4080582914184
"And I certainly _never_ shall give it	95.66447971612537
I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable	51.7719052006096
Your ladyship wants Mr	305.0436873482515
Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable	161.08414889433377
Supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin	108.28758886437254
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged	86.36939912169876
You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these	60.56673609930526
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine	95.46808164102431
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject	68.05260137564501
"Not so hasty, if you please	58.55057326395492
I have by no means done	56.1133944140611
To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add	100.58507502491646
I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement	67.98401735020241
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles	80.97556568095763
And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister	85.31296503218245
Is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother	140.57102849514035
Heaven and earth	6.470088945006456
--of what
are you thinking	62.991394724646426
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted	28.432160725328988
"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered	62.02460559626284
"You have insulted me, in every possible method	54.95929441715169
I must beg to return to
the house	36.570226016870585
And she rose as she spoke	38.69589579158485
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back	37.75842233264769
Her ladyship was highly incensed	29.930356198276346
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew	56.33357126145792
Unfeeling, selfish girl	5.152588232896946
Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	99.74528433461506
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say	16.367636721082114
You know my sentiments	64.5592713185988
"You are then resolved to have him	44.41604614466675
"I have said no such thing	162.95067036523173
I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	132.08893080080952
"It is well	15.912763503440093
You refuse, then, to oblige me	65.12691659305763
You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude	146.42244351834535
You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world	62.26108268453127
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance	71.70730340082052
No principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with Mr	69.47019348415755
Darcy	1.0
And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn	77.17239785336592
"And this is your real opinion	59.85379589073037
This is your final resolve	66.15080337756049
Very well	6.732970802418319
I
shall now know how to act	70.37281761384142
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified	63.25598093628327
I came to try you	25.382634576286897
I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point	113.04011606504356
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet	119.7569678142822
I send no compliments to your
mother	134.98389300684534
You deserve no such attention	176.41947381841842
I am most seriously displeased	66.08002085733361
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself	61.51982525622482
She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	118.22116070866369
Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself	120.03616286188267
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go	62.36524345315566
"She is a very fine-looking woman	29.73228296901659
and her calling here was prodigiously
civil	89.1930605425
for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well	99.17972044988474
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you	121.56885893035422
I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy	71.57817451828774
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	80.95332881282506
CHAPTER XV	42.39216444237812
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly	115.23513062729847
Lady Catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr	129.58670637755225
Darcy	1.0
It was a rational scheme to be sure	23.31546962915365
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea	111.5229878541657
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together	110.72362555375676
And her neighbours at
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time	194.486981375383
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference	100.37810747521901
From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce	60.89172720631669
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side	100.06280901618817
With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning	79.86297337674183
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him	92.24591632683244
In that case he would return no more	61.99907939222383
Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way	96.68432728697132
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to
understand it	98.33118103913593
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy	60.66134455296183
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all	133.83100559791038
*       *       *       *       *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs	51.98279951875678
Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	100.57154972276041
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	44.007365818964715
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room	59.64984970076985
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held	78.85353292893586
It suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations	62.275201250317735
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down	45.038285028384585
He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly	122.15803998516996
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents	99.09833672289318
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony	64.0845777870868
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest	41.32301544431727
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"You look conscious	86.12682824528405
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer	127.88875593535373
This letter is from Mr	54.84245495303195
Collins	1.0
"From Mr	11.19904697567431
Collins	1.0
and what can _he_ have to say	82.23185181571316
"Something very much to the purpose of course	36.446903783100105
He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases	121.83678065730119
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point	99.56026704788756
What relates to yourself, is as follows	66.31012145898838
"Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs	123.59123355638111
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority	76.28521628849155
Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land	107.37438968644722
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this	113.95603423884788
"This young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage	135.02169549302516
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of	88.33255844096568
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is	144.05678554675995
But now it comes out	107.58852818927727
"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows	78.18637784655571
We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye	44.11280354023018
"_Mr	1.0
Darcy_, you see, is the man	78.9777172090999
Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you	40.39197318640436
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related	95.27788304070612
Mr	1.0
Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life	86.11660642854781
It is admirable	20.739402622701878
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile	267.64205466500863
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her	122.69253835206945
"Are you not diverted	131.87764392673307
"Oh	1.0
yes	1.0
Pray read on	58.8863221220705
"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match	107.65732538728398
I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	100.94989885789477
"Mr	1.0
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known	115.0040588024621
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married	95.5975272123964
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it	172.187221865641
You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing	126.34358634254508
"_That_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness	67.2191569932159
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch	83.68703227594735
But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it	34.03358600721608
You are not going to be _Missish_, I
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	34.91623188566229
For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn	75.62635256484408
"Oh	1.0
cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted	16.080103969978957
But it is so
strange	21.088779769106623
"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing	76.10475528371899
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd	90.6078100961244
Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr	67.53540139624315
Collins's correspondence for any
consideration	36.891975017210385
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law	192.61271688544898
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report	75.77158356830648
Did she call to refuse her consent	109.43203393921827
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it	128.216931014655
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not	45.057475642543736
It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried	96.07413660337066
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr	75.5083579927372
Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_	75.90794266516788
CHAPTER XVI	39.85745414057073
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr	122.80011602961626
Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit	153.1858951884654
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs	160.00811291219372
Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out	103.70476156637831
It was agreed to	9.962353735697167
Mrs	1.0
Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together	66.4670735216394
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them	55.19345664590056
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
were to entertain each other	99.85383618232257
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same	116.76441118900524
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone	127.16894717300372
Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

"Mr	84.05312671487654
Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's	80.96401456242295
I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister	53.42980533685663
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it	68.38228724399299
Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express	106.75625325442512
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness	102.73011316102233
I did not think Mrs	16.825868558061938
Gardiner was so little to be trusted	39.64812655876583
"You must not blame my aunt	20.080606423899738
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars	56.328154626016655
Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them	63.58645704240706
"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone	50.64782508513334
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny	53.00382711682211
But your
_family_ owe me nothing	171.20702248748444
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought
only of _you_	132.73122531330193
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	37.18137107770878
After a short pause,
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me	89.58631530901305
If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once	71.41567063828712
_My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever	113.50972075274515
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances	113.43409313655847
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	89.58338512940513
Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable	94.19995546473953
They walked on, without knowing in what direction	85.94056654072293
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects	54.00827426530096
She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give	121.23228519183948
But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise	68.28328073876713
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before	69.77446775101932
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly	99.95605151631122
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_	79.00780976472845
After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations	115.51024185540835
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve	53.701719169839016
For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof	150.683568546294
It was
unpardonable	18.225497004694486
I cannot think of it without abhorrence	45.025980908249934
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth	78.55185294573886
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility	209.04566614309167
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	16.333701048722155
The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me	90.25367269533733
Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner	70.79854521250519
Those were your words	120.88513648652187
You know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice	79.12732119026987
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression	66.55488946895585
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way	44.96749884120512
"I can easily believe it	16.46156495091098
You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did	88.30567410314232
The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me	76.59309140983547
"Oh	1.0
do not repeat what I then said	57.084867011424826
These recollections will not do at
all	17.710986029489494
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it	64.8434823349022
Darcy mentioned his letter	71.15551572195493
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me	72.27437591216191
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents	70.40167617490695
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed	108.59725405484033
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary	55.512550525456646
I hope you have destroyed the letter	40.40362368328944
There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again	210.69156256291768
I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me	156.61911116590917
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies	70.79478189263794
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit	104.78413136818533
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so	112.20664767040051
The
adieu is charity itself	127.0675309742478
But think no more of the letter	45.71824658522626
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten	86.48213231443087
You must learn some
of my philosophy	116.01590451124815
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure	181.13180650525703
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	47.86930580716099
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance	90.62739771171896
But with _me_, it is not so	37.84830900810948
Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled	57.52610564147028
I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle	75.45823198020193
As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper	77.76107977150772
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit	121.66151285798925
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own	155.80584042268865
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth	199.02584335936743
What do I not
owe you	101.67691400163007
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous	172.8550324414267
By you, I was properly humbled	85.17943615413405
I came to you without a
doubt of my reception	50.130475051512775
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	94.41825121627082
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should	88.70683097967323
"Indeed I had	9.664174828238005
What will you think of my vanity	48.43282600314684
I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses	139.5013975064696
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you	55.130128679243896
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong	89.51660007601704
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening	71.31795401400782
"Hate you	4.337035070919671
I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction	125.11573825322043
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
Pemberley	57.67924850565144
You blamed me for coming	35.840120208711774
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise	110.42014268286182
"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you	103.64141561696614
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due	72.75945985394078
"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to	119.98178541224341
How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you	81.73106112130816
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend	95.12110300547003
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther	80.75598615956467
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home	87.13951373963724
"What could become of Mr	24.58438828538003
Bingley and Jane	14.703143999141474
was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs	178.33394794441224
Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it	79.30400623866377
"I must ask whether you were surprised	81.47626831737065
said Elizabeth	3.699587899331731
"Not at all	10.08920821509302
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen	43.999653355067444
"That is to say, you had given your permission	48.47926377441263
I guessed as much	63.55815006867626
And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case	43.20866078698235
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago	62.16808688156688
I told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent	76.48466242269384
His surprise was great	72.26608546157307
He had never had the
slightest suspicion	33.79799040866815
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together	105.77385421358306
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend	57.41685026722251
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring	151.96728836981038
"From the former	11.662363658654195
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection	81.52839852834852
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him	71.35066783167738
"It did	9.12918042847134
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest	29.548716676328795
His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy	145.17320737137894
I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him	142.64001767215936
I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him	83.05330447031582
He was
angry	19.18468840412484
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	93.84730566122417
He has heartily forgiven me
now	77.15279703246757
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr	25.1131402953987
Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself	109.4815011267646
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin	59.65344127031862
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house	92.12935691433646
In the hall they parted	40.1152105171881
CHAPTER XVII	36.78408853961752
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to	26.482643809576405
was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table	47.838447428048575
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge	76.07743486169261
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth	115.37303196497874
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary	38.71851672990652
The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent	162.93247220587372
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her	120.90204524480907
She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	121.61753548129526
At night she opened her heart to Jane	42.06249312962765
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here	71.99794764881648
"You are joking, Lizzy	19.164571696627597
This cannot be	18.917782034903883
--engaged to Mr	9.91917428727589
Darcy	1.0
No, no,
you shall not deceive me	77.68953245811258
I know it to be impossible	29.993461188444726
"This is a wretched beginning indeed	55.061800819859656
My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not	35.192605388712714
Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest	32.628188044820334
I speak nothing but the truth	53.61541305528742
He still loves me, and we are
engaged	66.38559250474141
Jane looked at her doubtingly	13.325322547519063
"Oh, Lizzy	5.090609271730952
it cannot be	7.594472120289791
I know how much
you dislike him	37.21267822705608
"You know nothing of the matter	26.22326270227659
_That_ is all to be forgot	33.972527335590065
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now	25.91026015984616
But in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable	124.15742863395445
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself	79.78257043539534
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement	29.588130843327967
Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth	68.83687928595697
"Good Heaven	12.345262921033322
can it be really so	77.87678828348186
Yet now I must believe you," cried
Jane	101.07061134855651
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain	63.148477392280945
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him	43.601529549459755
"There can be no doubt of that	31.216057967785893
It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world	47.12618816904448
But are you pleased,
Jane	126.77843248329224
Shall you like to have such a brother	36.749498662534826
"Very, very much	18.228281623009146
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight	133.5671151263648
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible	107.97520568691614
And do you
really love him quite well enough	51.14230130809045
Oh, Lizzy	5.090609271730952
do any thing rather than
marry without affection	131.5943189404646
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do	93.92710910170284
"Oh, yes	4.891929890542565
You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all	79.57027837248482
"What do you mean	17.019694958783333
"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley	45.27389322929744
I am
afraid you will be angry	9.944575757187348
"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious	54.13930036488047
I want to talk very seriously	60.35191528130026
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay	48.392986507340524
Will you tell
me how long you have loved him	44.19882154638259
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began	75.62817747158388
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley	97.80895402545413
Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment	76.77018557824074
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish	54.155896872792
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself	79.39232916388411
I
always had a value for him	75.59417114632635
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me	130.90101144056493
But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me	43.94363075973857
How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton	60.33602860031515
I owe all that I know
of it, to another, not to you	71.50686460306238
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	83.07958518085057
She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend	104.0443812797
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage	99.79170447805342
All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation	104.02724308461167
*       *       *       *       *

"Good gracious	1.6649039538633248
cried Mrs	4.666307015188249
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr	85.05907199034043
Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley	83.5644662493908
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here	53.96153709869727
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company	67.03508370860953
What shall we do with him	38.80405610221517
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way	63.024766623935015
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet	66.5989198879147
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr	109.5405307253421
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day	115.79156467628502
"I advise Mr	30.689604719639274
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs	57.36378875352047
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning	51.986437444500666
It is a nice long walk, and Mr	24.059491141314613
Darcy has
never seen the view	74.80755240538666
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr	51.49133661083103
Bingley; "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty	21.6079936180717
Wont it, Kitty	58.662144921693674
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	49.5763493936928
Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented	159.94092533177522
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs	36.905863720941866
Bennet followed her,
saying,

"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself	74.9385956518689
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then	71.13763436803025
So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience	82.18894577558241
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr	94.67088852353676
Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening	31.692965930275136
Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's	65.05178993646858
She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	92.12072403729626
But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr	71.95816945401923
Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation	77.18449116326963
*       *       *       *       *

In the evening, soon after Mr	8.392739586773127
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr	29.61762780890443
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme	78.90495154039039
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr	100.45544450024819
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile	93.84955349209169
In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library	91.3293732083669
She was gone directly	16.105603835931106
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious	60.58012021238202
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing	95.51944666924861
Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man	94.84906582950008
Have not you always hated him	55.36710789683372
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate	125.65388710934889
It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to Mr	71.15040410406714
Darcy	1.0
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him	67.635669945749
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane	110.144110265298
But will they make you happy	309.26240221675437
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference	80.8988761947659
"None at all	6.537531219006037
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him	75.46938751974541
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him	61.617365163560194
Indeed he has no improper pride	97.89112003126414
He is perfectly amiable	30.11270693556039
You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms	57.57807123842653
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent	53.68985203588086
He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask	52.94783844000339
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him	74.40037705172384
But let me advise you to think better of it	33.66331646923575
I know your
disposition, Lizzy	55.73346082886255
I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior	101.09215364843614
Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage	122.72267445735491
You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery	107.03039945996869
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life	105.24954919877942
You know not what you are
about	70.64882478986736
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr	147.97306380988866
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match	117.35547480160467
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say	66.05302755234274
If this be the case, he deserves you	95.87201619822255
I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy	97.84871407619626
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr	94.59869342048334
Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia	55.06694207486628
He heard her with astonishment	69.69521294121513
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed	167.2429681741008
And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission	127.48200806124783
So much the better	21.854594368625094
It will save me a world of trouble
and economy	107.05173935894499
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way	205.12055767879662
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter	61.24036695708243
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr	74.57733578156702
Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure	79.97076075030988
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure	63.1514260579055
Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time	102.46255763029717
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication	70.19473331104288
Its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs	186.64868830684247
Bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable	101.8278308928939
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them	81.4363884221169
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself	102.01781521905707
"Good gracious	5.9547309865505715
Lord bless me	3.417413687010469
only think	716.906209636423
dear me	17.774582038497687
Mr	1.0
Darcy	1.0
Who would
have thought it	17.77173972266803
And is it really true	83.72749963934318
Oh	1.0
my sweetest Lizzy	60.766121727120456
how rich
and how great you will be	38.32808816692827
What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have	34.47516754241144
Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all	33.15939502431411
I am so
pleased--so happy	22.707278472781592
Such a charming man	15.685367310708981
--so handsome	12.500224809144171
so tall	27.092678795155102
--Oh, my
dear Lizzy	6.1871835717505155
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before	61.73983202544576
I
hope he will overlook it	26.27725836844222
Dear, dear Lizzy	7.913134526054132
A house in town	32.78908214790706
Every thing
that is charming	31.326495752509047
Three daughters married	20.136113716746458
Ten thousand a year	16.310804325514063
Oh,
Lord	2.177797879698185
What will become of me	20.123136461434388
I shall go distracted	21.766077047304012
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away	76.3971229558809
But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her	45.15919749110989
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else	32.30678326361191
Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more	23.83655404701286
'Tis as good as a Lord	98.7198328122896
And a
special licence	20.23740601063603
You must and shall be married by a special licence	53.277792740082624
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr	215.0855884120704
Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow	66.28151325164673
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for	65.61824009808456
But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs	50.33547978957374
Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion	97.72229037481556
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr	29.91166471724708
Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem	97.09961782805824
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he	111.55396694815582
"Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's	82.54806321852276
CHAPTER XVIII	34.82033085670652
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr	100.47076327214991
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	80.03844794370173
"How could
you begin	34.21287158963946
said she	4.3269098540289095
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place	101.81347432975558
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation	78.55282152324293
It is too long ago	17.82593676600868
I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun	47.56238087347303
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	111.36835682252641
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence	114.48263009524419
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did	45.931011127674886
"You may as well call it impertinence at once	50.829969874547295
It was very little less	34.71699813807434
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention	71.24662161856622
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone	84.73522091539508
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_	102.51860193009533
Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you	125.18704925184147
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable	93.17531175261797
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love	77.12105848679089
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield	122.08713361809055
"Dearest Jane	3.062822007099597
who could have done less for her	79.75846649734449
But make a virtue of it
by all means	66.84424110432097
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last	82.19468468526733
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here	95.31388870548494
Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me	42.55532537939212
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement	92.4737056025186
"But I was embarrassed	25.016395679680862
"And so was I	70.79059135504006
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	56.24594554124362
"A man who had felt less, might	59.675079999307776
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it	55.327833685629074
But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself	47.08465940041689
I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you	48.60342598225173
My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect	128.2082432242566
_Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject	68.00215122141432
This will never do	74.52486251986582
"You need not distress yourself	39.50019169908553
The moral will be perfectly fair	136.56726851173985
Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts	97.6948467958446
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	106.61033143968811
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's	75.78912121026212
My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing	55.33457235260745
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use	89.76091563123002
But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for	50.9595391539904
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed	176.15095050568328
or had you intended any more serious consequence	118.63576276178631
"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me	100.58127555759025
My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made	99.4977009449306
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to
befall her	79.84466529887291
"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth	115.14696825813256
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly	39.07321638240443
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did	101.10667818901607
But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected	56.25411814069165
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr	69.6071447527469
Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs	54.49460235334239
Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write	84.51699878135096
You supposed more than
     really existed	80.11336541094312
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err	133.7370979161053
You must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last	67.2817332716701
I
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes	69.75291434113757
How could I
     be so silly as to wish it	74.31533305135862
Your idea of the ponies is delightful	55.576632419022005
We will go round the Park every day	25.11725681314771
I am the happiest creature in
     the world	47.98046311804096
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice	130.6639063792209
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I
     laugh	412.49155344420296
Mr	1.0
Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me	52.03035197660251
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas	47.18784470694413
Your's, &c	1.042784185590511
Mr	1.0
Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what Mr	66.97299546536536
Bennet sent to Mr	17.47297316002468
Collins, in
reply to his last	55.39896761877655
"DEAR SIR,

     "I must trouble you once more for congratulations	132.10574080410126
Elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of Mr	118.03024528818403
Darcy	1.0
Console Lady Catherine as well as
     you can	14.4021671771013
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew	101.72225453067026
He has
     more to give	25.84694121246344
"Your's sincerely, &c	572.0709065879896
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere	100.38158873209012
She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard	100.02099547205239
Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	113.90329434808743
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it	138.13552466014815
Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister	71.57338443463038
Before any answer could arrive from Mr	97.80343249409131
Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge	120.03342354762151
The reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident	105.05335605553573
Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over	75.63021137433701
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr	142.37470816365297
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband	33.105290933766405
He bore it however with admirable calmness	58.6216338612086
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St	105.29791886757114
James's, with very decent composure	133.18923800810126
If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight	47.74619183350376
Mrs	1.0
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs	103.54459070167046
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar	105.23696558820579
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant	97.4654944346656
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley	91.6932073469524
CHAPTER XIX	30.209671984467978
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs	64.04183921692213
Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters	105.09750963969626
With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs	128.62046303308236
Bingley and talked of Mrs	35.987241364937645
Darcy may be guessed	87.38289669165563
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly	82.42336407001986
Mr	1.0
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	85.60570511562346
He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected	91.59293822215791
Mr	1.0
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth	53.60533295938015
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart	83.08121535552489
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other	50.029994563181425
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters	69.7551480313631
In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great	86.93775167831528
She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid	93.69364429123418
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs	44.40193189689879
Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going	85.71456419445833
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs	89.19072658382703
Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone	41.82580613383084
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance	58.81681582451685
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters	92.45056305246229
He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune	75.59971226700895
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished	131.0043397704845
The letter was to this
effect:

     "MY DEAR LIZZY,

     "I wish you joy	45.02705992600302
If you love Mr	21.80923368786879
Darcy half as well as I do my dear
     Wickham, you must be very happy	26.27577450355073
It is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
     think of us	35.285328629007886
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help	127.78321150105664
Any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr	77.06016218417537
Darcy about it,
     if you had rather not	67.80530579739549
"Yours, &c	1.042784185590511
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	69.10922296318313
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them	76.01415766279968
It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills	170.46882699213782
Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme	230.19459184487818
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought	85.78876119176485
His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her	85.16753988505724
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession	120.58572662353092
Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone	104.8967031887606
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth	145.06305007047465
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see	62.708009464382464
They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended	54.58685847272556
Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother	78.22678198195096
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry	126.31900384624164
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way	60.31516883767826
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	77.18384087933354
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end	89.75883409974249
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	95.83266319788751
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms	57.134228514116984
Darcy,
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them	79.41999436935527

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
