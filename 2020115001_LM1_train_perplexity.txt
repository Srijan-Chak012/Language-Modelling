PRIDE & PREJUDICE	2.4177561630390056CHAPTER I	1.0It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife	2.8284511761592124Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last	2.4833795988928276Bennet replied that he had not	1.8220745969115721Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it	2.2756153433527935Bennet made no answer	1.016357716760774"Do not you want to know who has taken it	2.8502476611808945cried his wife impatiently	1.9340505445639584"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it	2.99028767328564This was invitation enough	1.2260545193149808"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs	2.497404111858004Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr	2.842655131814256Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week	3.624744959995275"What is his name	1.3527427145426627"Is he married or single	1.2513499088598494single, my dear, to be sure	1.984550376343868"How so	1.0how can it affect them	1.4911433274525263Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome	1.975570357296617You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them	2.884613415393364"Is that his design in settling here	1.7852310418344046nonsense, how can you talk so	1.4730799732467605But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes	3.9094101013742635You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr	2.9843475030044755Bingley might like you the best of the
party	2.0901569180467323"My dear, you flatter me	1.9387216592024867I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now	2.888712381840896When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty	2.666374804760073"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	2.413916908034608"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr	2.6447338838729246Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood	1.855899536763394"It is more than I engage for, I assure you	2.209279071137368"But consider your daughters	1.3028818786871375Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them	2.7234800397774883Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers	2.691078371636465Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not	2.622429777020237"You are over scrupulous surely	1.4838827785009097I dare say Mr	2.678537377028575Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy	3.125650647146516"I desire you will do no such thing	2.089611279178733"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters	2.62513045931991Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way	2.4801433162873825You take
delight in vexing me	1.7138044048171255You have no compassion on my poor nerves	2.236221305005547"You mistake me, my dear	1.2444624116422915I have a high respect for your nerves	2.3498871717787915They
are my old friends	1.3843802919028745I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least	2.19650978715763"Ah	1.0you do not know what I suffer	2.745791475957821"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	2.5322935030424576"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all	3.0120169146951867Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	2.3714353106507615_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope	1.9178844613576116CHAPTER II	1.0Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr	2.180287042777484Bingley	1.0He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it	3.019679221183567It was then disclosed in the following
manner	2.625917645708082Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"I hope Mr	2.8186959464397425"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr	3.08133326357546Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit	2.689642575154637"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs	2.5519965721886195Long has promised to introduce him	1.473530844761713"I do not believe Mrs	2.6829291122280807Long will do any such thing	1.83411925503888She has two nieces
of her own	1.7466934566259278She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her	3.206684088042342"No more have I," said Mr	1.5805991440023293Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you	3.7309094525679423Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters	2.2817603583329467"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake	1.7701437545336443"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill	2.7288985297107247"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully	3.0975124677373915"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy	2.133437642290137"To-morrow fortnight	1.0"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs	2.433627004569124Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself	3.2727056723049124"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr	3.1608174867410916Bingley to _her_	1.0"Impossible, Mr	1.0Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing	2.929563077090818"I honour your circumspection	1.2293181745365356A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little	1.7359516611830148One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight	2.2106921413592056But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs	2.5038382680702838Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself	2.630423053457525The girls stared at their father	1.563343994553788Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense	1.3774800525832736"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation	2.5012314975067205cried he	1.0I cannot quite agree with you _there_	1.7324162507111476What say you,
Mary	1.5741137035617805for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
books, and make extracts	2.743561659752443Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how	2.2720555376580776"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr	2.2468977188051347Bingley	1.0"I am sick of Mr	1.4188854630691627Bingley," cried his wife	1.0768377063818502If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him	3.0160624221820482It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now	2.992187876103654The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs	2.53659959240432Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while	3.624022879434335"How good it was in you, my dear Mr	2.7039709028131687But I knew I should
persuade you at last	2.28063251066749and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now	3.0837986464416414"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr	2.1009968172093303Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife	2.640906214044581"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut	2.5076844356019596"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter	2.69144619790963At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing	2.8273408092609653said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest	3.085163159362198The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr	2.4170148585856883Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner	2.224825939183409CHAPTER III	1.0Not all that Mrs	1.4042510213198487Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr	2.6169080056407537Bingley	1.0Her report was highly favourable	1.4975910651574784Sir William had been
delighted with him	1.619799505569655He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party	3.1052765529470094Nothing could be more delightful	2.480887657749991Bingley's heart were entertained	1.2293326966514213"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs	2.6702541260219106Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for	3.6292472402205993In a few days Mr	2.3721611838908823Bingley returned Mr	1.0Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library	2.734456567605947He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father	2.772031218149927The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	2.3603299009272067An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
Mrs	2.2677047665420043Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all	2.181711072216411Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c	3.236662140637863She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be	3.020777241545922Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr	2.9468376765791255Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	2.705924317783411The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin	2.6853515720464194And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr	2.341501917999699Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man	2.2335930418973486Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners	2.420183860910147His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion	2.2956838245587794His brother-in-law, Mr	1.0Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr	2.002486164200865Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year	2.7637465630964537The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr	2.7518482499784347Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend	2.8563242650901373Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield	2.6867490064603006Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves	1.7745054048943283What a contrast between him and his friend	2.3370659643956704Darcy danced
only once with Mrs	1.7130679730257248Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party	3.059954413806939His character was decided	1.6930701687140342He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again	3.048567929546569Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters	2.3073444391586393Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr	3.18138001960524Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr	2.733737077879756"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance	2.753990047180426I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	2.350264722198964You had much better
dance	1.7257213070748507"I certainly shall not	1.1741395939804262You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner	2.3501788781638964At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable	3.205033173956347Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with	3.095838491439424"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a
kingdom	3.3243018616551123Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty	2.911976973518221"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr	2.763420589108056Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet	1.7194308103497433But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say, very agreeable	3.2048061350293473Do let me ask my partner to introduce you	1.9235061234206665"Which do you mean	1.281998355707198and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men	3.1196766625023513You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me	2.824491753604547Bingley followed his advice	1.337238255873142Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	2.13927604561061She told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous	2.81818589686974The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	1.9459166169358109Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party	2.4227335618030863Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters	2.631351837402452Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball	3.1706618301145393They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants	2.6340983245118403They found Mr	1.0Bennet still up	1.0He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear	2.980958384629948my dear Mr	1.0I wish you had been there	1.4798757444655581Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it	2.1484829982975753Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr	2.1140379229056165First of all, he asked Miss Lucas	1.8924643538672083I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance	3.2303138103182505So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next	2.768142072771087For God's sake, say no more of
his partners	2.3626489699477955that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	4.454485161675683my dear," continued Mrs	1.2179414828869932Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him	2.4787086524362696He
is so excessively handsome	1.8166386174967053and his sisters are charming women	2.147582156492273I never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	2.0988926513904373I dare say the
lace upon Mrs	2.8649845732922596Hurst's gown----"

Here she was interrupted again	1.782903735406019Bennet protested against any
description of finery	1.600440159053007She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr	2.4485256048444874"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing	2.9424211027585914He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great	2.1747135450116892Not handsome enough to dance with	1.2036761938039753I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs	2.850788286724634I quite detest the man	1.3505387685926578CHAPTER IV	1.0When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr	2.74050083002476Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him	2.389777141170472--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding	1.8010658977700427"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can	2.5739444228241153His character is thereby complete	1.421979096574203"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	2.518895878346272I
did not expect such a compliment	2.464913748028094"Did not you	1.0_I_ did for you	1.2936081703383955But that is one great difference between
us	2.208126555720832Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never	2.0656774868773207What
could be more natural than his asking you again	2.373905897657035He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room	2.7632177170567727No thanks to his gallantry for that	1.8714333583193894"Dear Lizzy	1.0you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general	3.2429611100619296All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes	2.4536279387807194"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
what I think	3.1547492201958622"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	2.8546918983424283With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others	2.512397029782389Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where	1.7804270735977368But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone	3.8881262874624927And so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you	1.8713283459432373Their manners are not equal to his	2.008258677602491"Certainly not; at first	1.3031223093889481But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them	2.194267251136159Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her	3.215956588728243Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them	3.273142741076232They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited	2.8300826226715876They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others	2.9322042079070467They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade	2.5001598128972597Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it	2.3958831492782027Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase	3.0803969303406373His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs	3.381281685811021Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her	2.6432637143421904Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at Netherfield House	2.9054037729148185He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately	2.798774648662961--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied	3.3016643874437115On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion	2.5005121710417892In
understanding Darcy was the superior	1.7584840091909417Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever	2.2342124601733295He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting	2.234804942873699In
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	2.3073930500933755Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence	2.1837400314352187The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic	2.5363188267293144Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful	3.2292954859452974Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure	2.8399084564206056Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of	3.3836449144876815CHAPTER V	1.0Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate	2.4448453970975055Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty	3.0990882329846148The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	1.6729750574954454It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	3.0444292679348126For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body	2.981535915942463James's had made him
courteous	1.7157268455464667Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs	2.9128051137886906--They had several children	1.224895719693008The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend	2.1079965367769287That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate	2.8978905530597077"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs	1.9065878607911018Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas	1.9337259225263317"_You_ were Mr	1.0Bingley's first choice	1.0"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better	2.2216753059209564--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice	1.9259365789651826To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr	2.7756119000306207"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr	1.8239054401248744Robinson; did not
I mention it to you	2.491318877658861Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest	3.2096883514921717and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh	2.0024861564284593the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point	2.2566721107273113"Upon my word	1.0--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know	2.4845003338752294"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte	2.3850862341131807Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he	2.7844839945722737--Poor Eliza	1.0--to be only just _tolerable_	1.5017279481815757"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him	3.284826541295938Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	2.443424810151738"Are you quite sure, Ma'am	1.5010040912351974--is not there a little mistake	1.7314151786415612said
Jane	1.0--"I certainly saw Mr	1.2089956215651523Darcy speaking to her	1.2344742653544907"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to	2.9561019843079666With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable	1.7395731474289207"I do not believe a word of it, my dear	2.778701344832229If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs	3.1871895363984817Long	1.0But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs	3.136943865857764Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise	3.1877145246933307"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs	2.9720515083737356Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza	2.547948658090249"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you	2.828169135767146"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him	1.984030158967013"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it	2.731338218070381One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself	2.806306189696792"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_	3.043446291156213"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe	2.528164932298827By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary	3.2195569517052043Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously	2.1891414324932597A person may be
proud without being vain	1.8777063229611075Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us	2.3343861972420394"If I were as rich as Mr	2.1306068877523834Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was	2.707767561940184I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day	2.3177608919520996"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs	2.1509270306050605Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle
directly	3.214937017258205The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit	2.742736130645222The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield	2.318527621336729Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of Mrs	2.044039472538689Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest	2.849894339491179By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration	2.9395996251582015It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent	3.1969010812830203She mentioned this to her friend Miss
Lucas	1.6950253458229927"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded	3.1900592127498624If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark	3.018982502083056There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself	2.987291564162607We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement	2.4350828646545755In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels	2.1862326559139187Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on	2.489933372008549"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow	2.8607523065017175If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too	3.1503922022968798"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do	2.5277778911414437"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out	2.63173354523626"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her	1.9370688500528126But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together	2.704349791466287Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention	2.560913601418089As yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness	2.6566184567215534She has known him only a fortnight	1.8442324094549765She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times	2.7279052976757834This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character	2.9427136675999894"Not as you represent it	1.505408475258997Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal	2.657832738797816"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded	3.174518474579858"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth	3.0462220038434884Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	2.000185516799629If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least	2.993206300509703They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life	2.767310592101116"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound	2.303074001541428You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself	3.2552482458475995Occupied in observing Mr	1.217882912379662Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend	3.3484109218827465Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise	3.098627806551404But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	3.027214754645135To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	1.7306871950592517Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness	3.363452558918783Of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with	3.013915718196591He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others	3.1026191857721206His doing so
drew her notice	1.5033697248098956It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled	2.3436184389454873"What does Mr	1.0Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster	2.222423869445646"That is a question which Mr	1.6223904912131855Darcy only can answer	1.3024048304083609"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about	3.5377116152838637He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him	3.1800184454137277On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"Did not you think, Mr	3.0641503103816006"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic	3.269538231124064"You are severe on us	1.2090433528473212"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas	2.7222463223920705"I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows	2.3893006923894227"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend	2.4679891246294585--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body	2.2105573218542847--If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers	3.038012733335362On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must	2.4633275822754643And gravely glancing
at Mr	1.3431246686564948Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song	2.8597792339668633Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital	2.1141711558392275After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display	2.9032899770488254Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached	2.6242338395938773Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room	2.9899150930935026Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began	2.6723231167713157"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr	1.9905979727919534--There
is nothing like dancing after all	2.1622224792791225--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies	2.473448477158304"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world	2.4330892173969647"Your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr	3.072851621632021"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir	1.9677033338530376"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	2.121785000400052Do
you often dance at St	1.5657933995807798James's	1.0"Never, sir	1.0"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	3.189434531461992"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it	3.063905132156798"You have a house in town, I conclude	2.44505221093679Darcy bowed	1.0"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas	2.4930464641894803He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing	3.0550349813245643Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner	2.829300080829771--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you	2.5589557317045526And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr	2.574329193707805Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing	2.7118192463271766--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner	2.5095091168750034Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain	2.773730832100023Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	2.2439977601269487"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour	3.1956473395516567Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling	1.8177489579760058"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner	2.802565174033177Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away	1.3216581541186376Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,

"I can guess the subject of your reverie	3.2264742735867853"I should imagine not	1.2244703155234584"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion	3.0765022978325085I was never more annoyed	1.5107155421858336The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people	2.389784534138703--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them	2.1231047272471084"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you	1.5359443090537037My mind was more
agreeably engaged	1.725890427135855I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	2.9082721832457246Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	2.5209331305988547Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet	2.2542200188727843How long has she been such a favourite	2.185378961904668"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask	2.470911085857946A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment	2.2476151792593306I knew you would be wishing me joy	1.9424276791431225"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled	3.031194040463046You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you	3.108132622424631He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long	2.7692349845251325Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his	2.705254928940285Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds	2.3125793815211413She had a sister married to a Mr	2.5397423236298824The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way	2.761850514685933The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt	2.845729497336329At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters	2.781272709680734Their visits to Mrs	1.30271211074614Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence	3.4827875552538363Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections	2.399732767533535Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves	2.785733788915326Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before	2.347247837848542They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr	2.1128760697495856After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr	2.827557951522273Bennet coolly observed,

"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country	3.1077513553105787I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced	2.575528048067773Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London	3.0345018176754697"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs	1.988342860107598Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly	3.0716629616295683If I wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however	2.983361406665887"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it	2.4451149959075305"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever	2.703623970132738"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree	2.8817772219099704I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish	3.0294830909250035Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother	3.139421112123407--When they get to our age I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do	2.7784561695172156I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
regimentals	2.726869860880199"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library	2.734334981141239Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer	2.5522681520733523Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from	2.7580229356561814what is it about	1.7938719789424762Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love	1.9970085884437923"My dear Friend,

     "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel	2.887470955322878Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this	2.311451652359101My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	2.6039455761871846Yours ever,

     "CAROLINE BINGLEY	1.1888545057233804"With the officers	1.0cried Lydia	1.0"Dining out," said Mrs	1.2802534636229412Bennet, "that is very unlucky	2.2725549817258077"Can I have the carriage	2.0282469450680862said Jane	1.0"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night	2.8440672051397375but the gentlemen will have Mr	1.769316075772611Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs	2.3813426727728224"I had much rather go in the coach	1.9311162144133256"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure	2.4103475230373483They are
wanted in the farm, Mr	1.3451475290436399Bennet, are not they	1.4043450088531286"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them	1.8925196773613968She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged	2.989122304764298Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day	3.1630084171072186Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard	2.6798021852211527Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted	2.9265467148205495The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back	2.0901696663328795"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed	1.8595987060899202said Mrs	1.0Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	2.6919145635918453Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance	3.2985933294059926My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better	2.3749281013068284They insist also on
     my seeing Mr	1.6991605384521544Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me	3.307781806948038"Yours, &c	1.0"Well, my dear," said Mr	1.3656947381177986Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr	3.1845682656838386Bingley, and under your orders	1.5113472325741266I am not at all afraid of her dying	3.007625080867467People do not die of little
trifling colds	1.756594417952718She will be taken good care of	2.110555749659011As long as she stays
there, it is all very well	2.983077679821428I would go and see her, if I could have the
carriage	2.8536797044328877Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative	3.247364011539063She declared her resolution	1.228432857152658"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt	3.2967296342267765"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want	2.6961359113393186"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses	2.525402424499526I do not wish to avoid the walk	3.8686290683787643The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles	2.069248343482437I shall be back by dinner	2.388910666501356--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together	1.9541915142764124"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes	2.4014916487764726In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise	3.055805433571279She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise	2.6914382098064102--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs	2.7168824516922783Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it	2.543290788343601She was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness	2.6741626314894402Darcy said very
little, and Mr	1.8156985902322935Hurst nothing at all	1.0349282046258932The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone	3.0402394896459595The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast	1.9361921364848333Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	2.334445329734479Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room	2.7867957596864024Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance	2.8251294342402917Elizabeth silently attended
her	1.1529228109826535The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts	2.960223993073804The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely	2.1275111735856647Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere	2.9373697165538384When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so	2.663274527567444Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present	2.85004543648073Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes	2.4660882960760135At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner	2.1882009270672063To the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr	2.66747838335644Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer	3.315293362718225Jane was by no means better	2.099522643755027The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	2.806953751126291Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency	3.129240787885575She had very little notice from any but him	1.9457432224950522Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr	2.088088724932633Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr	2.64759395959142Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her	2.665058656245385When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	3.089320509340985Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty	2.957979429689759Hurst
thought the same, and added,

"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker	2.676894005760253I shall never forget her appearance this morning	1.7653062994050273She really
looked almost wild	1.3884465342515453I could hardly keep my countenance	1.887157168612333Very
nonsensical to come at all	1.5000210644272491Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold	2.5887229570181813Her hair so untidy, so blowsy	1.8494800382288472"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office	2.950987166519448"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me	2.4499389021651785I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning	2.507875489769006Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice	1.554406351288759"_You_ observed it, Mr	1.2273351796849912Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition	3.363566713224795"Certainly not	1.0what could she mean by
it	1.7023417129302745It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum	2.432003223719349"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley	3.070143689811065Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes	2.2881017991800845"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise	3.184987448145415--A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs	2.037805988742039Hurst began again	1.0"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled	2.5438988289923183But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it	3.0643895548696185"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton	1.9794881363366035"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside	2.0735108222596463"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily	2.4948114740833343"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable	3.131779479193766She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself	3.580297245245603Hurst looked at her with astonishment	2.088016606359999"Do you prefer reading to cards	1.4851269211954132"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards	2.137296031802144She is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else	2.6288940313083935"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things	2.9915591060941678"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	2.999173640332011Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying	2.679772410510552"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into	3.2610584876219635Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room	2.6329790439623797"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books	2.713196367653384--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr	2.0892012258647257"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations	2.973742559399171"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books	2.5708663119191826"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these	2.1601799397501797"Neglect	1.0I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place	2.5706158886283585Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley	2.611853554488489There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire	2.283065460061567"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it	2.1843823447485087"I am talking of possibilities, Charles	1.6912214868612647"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation	2.7196357602543415Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr	2.9072003613561055Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game	2.5221587364212796"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring	2.152499732471346said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am	2.586225035804153"I think she will	1.3452191441936057She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller	1.9399599364954212I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much	1.9451653230331212Such a countenance, such manners	1.482671143291998Her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite	1.7217858122331036"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are	2.5742467641347333"All young ladies accomplished	1.4013757191091465My dear Charles, what do you mean	1.44106389322127"Yes, all of them, I think	2.1887830839076337They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses	2.4855484627666646"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth	2.3080104731414814But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	2.861512452072167I
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished	2.6266239345664486"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley	1.81358181368109"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman	2.4620714444453573"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it	2.093367877746472certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with	2.315863825319642A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved	2.4912739253841383"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading	2.8362077271499286"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women	2.1868223637033504I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_	1.7617688838594554"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this	2.538425115439309Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr	2.417651874653991Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	1.9704555054177884As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room	2.21058556446878"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds	3.1119055650581195"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation	2.5612467603441154Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable	1.8208308960231905Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject	2.994879749742951Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her	3.5999092137657334Bingley urged Mr	1.0Jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians	2.4965058635108717This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr	3.227386568817568Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better	2.43425643102344Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable	2.5714509002653054They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	2.580094668258404Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr	3.012746262670293Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters	2.315209070242728The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with	1.8841931084090786Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast	2.3911432844876037Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs	1.972542725628616Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield	2.9644210722266457She
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable	2.965571869180305After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour	2.5762955069484375Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs	1.809471027096527"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer	1.9655106087039325"She is a great deal too ill to be
moved	2.545695977474269"Removed	1.0cried Bingley	1.0"It must not be thought of	2.257446175726079My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal	2.9275224841003595Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	1.6487095417367152"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with	3.484573685665711I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_	2.1542984866297807You have a sweet room here, Mr	2.078459509094776Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk	1.7459348921706694I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield	3.088737681319369You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
hope, though you have but a short lease	3.2345017721412708"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes	2.664526512774772At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here	1.9755292715527275"You begin to comprehend me, do you	1.8027093447680713cried he, turning towards her	1.2103044603901936yes--I understand you perfectly	1.22933790289378"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful	3.6548298536711235"That is as it happens	1.6554137053265354It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	2.3821319848035323"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	2.86143761362974"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing	1.7592005665170898They have at
least that advantage	1.965586175117963"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study	2.351529140703986In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society	2.3482313762444154"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever	2.7673891530852543"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs	1.3261119132049508Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood	1.991789570571231Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away	3.0712033843599786"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places	2.9827010050581797The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr	2.1553510814647527Bingley	1.0"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town it is pretty much the same	2.998820872301815They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either	2.3671998848387403"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition	2.344718264429593But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all	2.29762889645913"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother	2.6244881630608257"You quite mistook Mr	1.3339406234087205He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true	3.0245182867113853"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger	2.767304138988956I know we dine with four and twenty families	1.8829257868537803Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance	2.3674865707874324Darcy with a very expressive smile	1.9245150019598256Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away	2.8612603508042844"Yes, she called yesterday with her father	1.731884287747952What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr	1.839894971042738so much the man of fashion	2.4513392860121317so
genteel and so easy	1.5414430167988549--He has always something to say to every
body	2.182901538267236--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter	2.225295564806818"Did Charlotte dine with you	1.3725284409506957"No, she would go home	1.8353277682355897I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	1.925302051465023For
my part, Mr	1.8354592270626062Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently	2.2827778855230023But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you	2.47329795417964It is a pity they are not handsome	3.402169165668002Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	2.8078980051269933dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain	2.3428281562900835Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty	2.2927480964851745It is what every body says	1.9146000396796583I do not trust my own
partiality	3.3650480695407095But however he did not	1.0889508298053678Perhaps he thought her too young	1.7224124157729706However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were	2.4710061784763684"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently	1.8470518467878472"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy	4.069302377884824"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may	1.670949659607867Every thing nourishes what is
strong already	1.9574007516122471But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	2.8535302347812785Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	2.2534709851875956She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs	2.9998323901478683Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr	1.6405542776730113Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required	2.64845342708736She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs	2.1029203853748664Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage	2.144389131030546Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward	2.1474408871020416The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr	2.769755886057936Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield	2.376011339715759Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age	2.408410238252036She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance	2.6650883626341537She was very
equal therefore to address Mr	2.2944062303917017Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	3.2352462467303877His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear	2.1466602112427684But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	2.2636641499058205Lydia declared herself satisfied	1.3368394798209375yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again	2.680069427967512And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also	2.5064451009055233I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	2.2443036787895023Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr	2.823708940324283Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_	3.0406085788494472CHAPTER X	1.0The day passed much as the day before had done	2.7825707738044514The loo table, however, did not appear	1.694160520118722Hurst and Mr	1.0Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs	1.977066836990004Hurst was observing their game	1.3814128614931025Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion	2.696714294947776The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each	3.160691693427062"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter	2.293944326634421He made no answer	1.034147413391726"You write uncommonly fast	1.216289572049026"You are mistaken	1.0I write rather slowly	1.227524481924992Letters of business too	1.3018630927640882How odious I should think them	2.138162418371636"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	2.215810688379047"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her	1.8479258366155689"I have already told her so once, by your desire	2.2294100203925966Let me mend it for you	1.5963281358362735I mend
pens remarkably well	1.310288766141402"Thank you--but I always mend my own	1.817589138514171"How can you contrive to write so even	2.3284938385099645He was silent	1.0"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's	3.3463848260883156--At
present I have not room to do them justice	3.0397627647386876it is of no consequence	1.9641121554817047But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr	2.0744170259215458"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine	2.7060487883137867"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill	2.825939294816886"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease	3.0453551081637884He studies too much for
words of four syllables	2.1469163521430064--Do not you, Darcy	2.08089942438519"My style of writing is very different from yours	2.1069848304662604cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable	3.5635343876845016He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest	2.34089189840971"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	2.7244077569255865"Your humility, Mr	1.0Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof	1.8428898652355155"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility	2.390590109791067It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast	1.8877034478790762"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty	2.4229092189844152"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting	2.513011883438901The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance	3.194105245914099When you told Mrs	1.457127276213711Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	3.0150166593130128"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning	2.661128248069649And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment	2.7771118492588407At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	2.448978385665704Your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month	2.9855316737519746"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr	2.022321263416806Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition	2.845820562683495You have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself	2.3378291499354207"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	2.4831270723247623But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could	3.34596622299762Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it	2.7738256718419296"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself	2.425929768057359"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged	2.8298904558452325Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety	2.703965218585708"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you	2.3237364077849625"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either	2.1158697253875256"You appear to me, Mr	1.9209573414685372Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection	2.083797306040678A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it	2.473227060658891I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr	3.3999458891975864Bingley	1.0We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon	2.5672444176787224But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it	2.8412857821284865"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of	2.607705374857592I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference	3.110203382097271I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do	2.6081824051684013Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh	2.922319513051939Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense	2.7817899350223656"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend	1.8743202703666144--"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this	1.8189309474110449"Perhaps I do	1.0Arguments are too much like disputes	1.8284167567324174If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me	3.0399534905118353"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr	2.2159513004003726Darcy had much better finish his letter	1.6429385445590767Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	1.812942174135041When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music	2.810866764637614Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself	2.6032877183815426Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her	1.5411203976642316She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present	2.867585367941897She liked
him too little to care for his approbation	2.3968066371583046After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr	2.5968143712074228Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her--

"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel	3.1220156103191776She smiled, but made no answer	1.3818130819995746He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence	2.1309532099818194You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt	3.1549634981653867I have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare	2.9926904038863595"Indeed I do not dare	3.0746831172555726Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	3.2657479660114896He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger	2.7545634033622504Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth	2.4575349580335812She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance	2.435437303159851"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers	3.206499124345734--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses	2.4454464223353733yes	1.0Put them next to your great uncle
the judge	1.9475259677856878They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines	2.552618566580298As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	2.8548007588119653At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs	2.4480854217563817Hurst and
Elizabeth herself	1.4053549543797443"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard	3.419996413118077Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out	2.457965014536217Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr	1.596969985793025Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself	2.010333411353882The path just admitted three	1.376359696419172Darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"This walk is not wide enough for our party	2.214307385321345We had better go into the
avenue	2.0129096845048045But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are	2.5187592712961275--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage	1.7371530998726366The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth	2.043851585047461She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two	2.5071686448941315Their powers of conversation were considerable	1.6829017634759473They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit	2.192064988050298But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object	2.9268293125059803Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	2.9891253588696975He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr	2.638491648214455Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation	2.7107216442168496He was full of joy and
attention	1.7063718527743685The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door	3.1070789421798053He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else	2.41475901487208When tea was over, Mr	1.6131040578596902Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain	3.4336683091618925She had obtained private intelligence that Mr	1.5601124821581258Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr	1.9882882885593132Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected	1.762878612282966She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her	3.1499977136337023Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep	2.9114917213015783Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs	2.4034801293797456Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr	2.1064046085464945Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page	2.7335250795466215She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on	2.8828261945912783At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way	3.243382172336842How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book	2.7083597676280284--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library	4.083956944945431She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield	2.816644177074875"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards	2.9921913064495183"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	3.3648825185849933It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day	2.204107898060302"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball	2.637282732090711Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room	2.1848170051425555Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious	2.7267268653160683In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room	2.956767755887223--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude	2.7866268221304793Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately	2.0796854826965294Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr	2.4262809215586087Darcy looked
up	1.0He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book	2.5512841362134417He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere	2.5914913573409817"What could he mean	1.371969645565571she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him	2.575731507375006"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it	2.816253263369519Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr	1.8280767400969464Darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives	2.6463431840513576"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak	2.661471096363909shocking	1.0cried Miss Bingley	1.0"I never heard any thing so
abominable	1.8930007076133175How shall we punish him for such a speech	2.2620295571999884"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth	2.3821335786849227"We
can all plague and punish one another	1.741386274635116--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done	2.9389438837510626"But upon my honour I do _not_	1.559354685914712I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_	2.2387962395488796Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind	1.825393557872989No,
no--I feel he may defy us there	1.8427596810493807Darcy may hug himself	1.3638129904980396Darcy is not to be laughed at	2.769441422760734"That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance	2.8396684735770936I dearly love a
laugh	1.4511082648318299"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be	2.4266276789150765"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_	2.886106160956252I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good	2.0609446169904997Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can	2.493259377410405--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without	2.4247835319732336"Perhaps that is not possible for any one	2.2520782438274805But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule	2.563737514921902"Such as vanity and pride	1.2310655132080448"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed	1.6581270918862048But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation	2.6270243813167484Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	1.7805967861067746"Your examination of Mr	1.295334528632439Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result	2.3823157408161553"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr	2.187062801632929He owns it
himself without disguise	1.5708930846294744"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension	2.1446912905202797I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding	2.3264704021354365My temper I dare not vouch
for	2.025969926468712--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world	2.3086400578845705I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself	2.8867440670488027My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	2.1939351833564773My temper
would perhaps be called resentful	1.7504970208719224--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever	1.5894628917608273"_That_ is a failing indeed	1.8438581095077813--cried Elizabeth	1.0"Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character	1.8169881689139227"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome	2.4062301917867677"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body	2.5442799436994306"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them	2.1273605878002586Hurst	1.0Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it	2.611474184754918He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention	2.452869935560451CHAPTER XII	1.0In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day	2.851693082126555But Mrs	1.0Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before	2.701978149169564Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home	3.0168828468477393Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr	2.890456744086297Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well	2.8221066181977905--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr	2.7053910386639815Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made	2.628392894623514The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred	2.665066138039504Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	2.804368831983732The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right	3.5324606675199Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough	2.8697427470273817She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself	3.0472952532609185He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it	2.8790389895096395Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her	3.2295532818058708On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place	1.9957162167390676Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former	2.8786377201701225--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	2.3815320376133413They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	2.1772633233465566Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again	2.5970554664119976--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle	3.0724454426673167They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to	2.2172651383906317Catherine and Lydia had
information for them of a different sort	2.589436231987453Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married	3.1150895806936076"I hope, my dear," said Mr	1.791914380648812Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party	3.4240186119241205"Who do you mean, my dear	2.1031855316384074I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her	2.9979513163802567I do not believe she often sees such at home	2.5796273506489027"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger	2.616842963762589Bennet's eyes sparkled	1.0Bingley
I am sure	1.2262572752526744Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr	2.9812880776094404Bingley	1.0--But--good
lord	1.0how unlucky	1.0there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day	2.1717116654500517I must speak to Hill, this moment	1.8471512988276597This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	2.4719857661760694"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention	2.693546028270576It is from my cousin, Mr	1.8466434904831823Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	2.872824539439157my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned	2.503565664069444Pray do not talk of that odious man	2.2115675293402175I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it	3.4729051910033584Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	2.8664687762705885Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	2.977036561488654"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr	2.404359189491661But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself	2.9682514116619787"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical	3.830366299606148I hate such false
friends	1.3828713708046048Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him	2.1742313747576607"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear	2.7372621140488693_

     DEAR SIR,

     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance	3.2678280900744494--"There, Mrs	1.0--My mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the Church of England	3.210065258641533As a clergyman, moreover, I
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	2.950507509767709I cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter	2.984610844997396If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day	2.741577047462269I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     WILLIAM COLLINS	2.486826554309451"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr	2.0095373649735837Bennet, as he folded up the letter	2.5516257562306826"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him	3.0498020666542858"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit	2.865186627831479Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required	2.806481309998648"He must be an oddity, I think," said she	2.706053484980509"I cannot make him
out	1.5618480784266775--And what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail	1.7728914662496815--We cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could	2.0445574522349688--Can he be a sensible man, sir	1.9786774821476945"No, my dear; I think not	2.4366785901386003I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse	2.134970969075556There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well	3.316331314886928I am impatient to see him	1.47887209710495"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective	2.559172299396553To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting	2.4355766268762093It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	3.0307018120311144As for
their mother, Mr	1.6732921988653635Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters	3.1245483589345193Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family	2.400072639041642Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr	2.61469218900187Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself	2.142370479705722He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty	2.4797200767197642He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs	2.3150488092412163Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	2.8656247747278565This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs	3.203861066527922Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough	2.896750428088506Things are settled so
oddly	1.366409189880078"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	2.2676357711532056"Ah	1.0sir, I do indeed	1.3976404650450533It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess	2.7605122098534403Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world	2.779097890267428There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed	2.5277776522120026At present I will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other	3.002942570742945They were not the only objects of Mr	2.4826994846344075Collins's admiration	1.0The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs	2.7939525590169114Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property	2.4150514635217837The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing	2.612761758827314Bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	3.1509777443329208He begged
pardon for having displeased her	1.6764415613479093In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour	2.2677144229458164CHAPTER XIV	1.0During dinner, Mr	1.0Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	2.910723663642077Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable	2.6567757212034144Bennet could not have chosen
better	3.04191772731496Collins was eloquent in her praise	2.1705447633569586The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine	3.045635017018877She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her	3.4441477888166956Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	2.9373962925693133She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations	3.014295082767131She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs	3.2350488338536025"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs	2.8079469361742326Bennet, "and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman	2.784542081685376Does she live near you, sir	1.5010549444850327"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence	2.2992723578744743"I think you said she was a widow, sir	2.567656074358729has she any family	1.2291200057870484"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property	2.9500028217799135"Ah	1.0Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls	2.125474169663176And what sort of young lady is she	2.2099531220595128is she handsome	1.0Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth	2.7940923797443693She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them	2.7831359381567102But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	2.5933752364719185"Has she been presented	1.5712963944110607I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court	2.9650848567568007"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British court of its brightest ornament	2.734472660598638I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her	2.9705454856478695"You judge very properly," said Mr	1.4843292398192738Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	2.530369303062485"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible	2.843223397583198Bennet's expectations were fully answered	1.3714432419794884His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure	2.973905398494121By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr	2.594263330783852Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	2.5588092803942484Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels	2.79171374182566--Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed	2.008737375002806--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce's Sermons	2.1556219440287108Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him	2.8457145359965623My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday	2.0545344253395657I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr	2.6160319718349907Denny comes back from town	1.452280810909068Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr	2.498293273601117Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit	2.457770058790744It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction	2.934098797765726Then turning to Mr	1.3298928218523238Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	2.4016579148880863Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr	2.6964370758348344Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr	2.3985263404836417Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon	1.424151256835897CHAPTER XV	1.0Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance	3.362299186506721The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity	3.2749459372656657Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	3.095711130734464This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part	3.287587218574293His plan did not vary on seeing them	1.9567573335919741--Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice	2.8896509201561837The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs	2.5071406824419524Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on	2.8040677046265032--"As to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged	3.1262028342550625Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs	3.1266582982892244Bennet was stirring the fire	2.441331699786831Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course	2.173110400733477Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr	2.656079055592894Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr	2.2468435054950193Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr	2.482100294477457Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr	3.1514605307585586Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford	2.911518679110794Such
doings discomposed Mr	1.160235246593462In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr	2.859888845714852Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr	2.318370895774098Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go	2.3293716505497852In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton	2.80086672142491The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_	2.4937889995976894Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them	2.439433622123291But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way	2.8520923151076314The officer was the very
Mr	1.7886324900017427Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed	2.1526110992793193All were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot	2.715449188029589Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr	2.026904736298475Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps	3.118373903616717This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming	3.0612680918180595His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address	2.7062359701073153The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street	2.650835977936987On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities	2.5793001658081782Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object	2.794569627952505He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her	2.6493365192534677Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	2.916872312938173Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red	1.8780571000574424Darcy just deigned to return	1.3242752895960777What could be the meaning of it	2.097821506193385--It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know	2.517836182987891In another minute Mr	1.2150898144476616Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend	2.165190136043128Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr	3.0542050269241723Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation	1.9655157903123357Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr	3.240885460364287Jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr	2.962398438990247Collins by Jane's introduction of him	1.5485252734657653She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice	2.8818665480122156Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr	2.641499427787035Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire	3.331508690335569Wickham
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows	2.8953350116316496Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr	2.865354134278053Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening	2.344158589505464This was agreed to, and Mrs	1.7305803725736462Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	2.3119688951507165Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	2.7753394036998595As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister	3.122360506326884Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs	2.021916026343597Bennet by admiring Mrs	1.160836254937253Philips's manners and politeness	1.2293484349629382He protested that except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before	3.1406401605142977Something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life	2.8719347545147365As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr	2.600063532246044Collins's scruples of leaving Mr	1.4781317673352747Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr	2.873930468504045Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house	2.1768568198086693When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr	2.3948816018048182Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs	2.941047214220383Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room	3.01367815472504In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs	3.1315280245357857To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long	3.0897111146264It was over at last however	1.775008923227924The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr	1.8763290637553045Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	2.860583143764157The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr	3.015842565609433Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room	3.041006917601245Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker	3.1161925655931406Wickham and the
officers, Mr	1.9351851102635749Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in Mrs	2.5451945066101365Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	2.057326936747232When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist	2.2497812573834817"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs	2.760327727235099Philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason	2.253718812494148Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia	2.363983033541626At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular	2.8378593717960343Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr	3.5611670662077897Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr	3.460381948678565She dared not
even mention that gentleman	2.155418855897485Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved	1.5741266547249528Darcy had been staying there	2.06050497150535"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand	3.0380925289728333"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one	2.383381470421488You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	3.1215577147155673Elizabeth could not but look surprised	2.4740986005768835"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday	2.4954243855229254--Are you much acquainted with Mr	1.4793848336912887"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable	3.7208194092741667"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise	3.1041075968803105I am not qualified to form one	2.6762406742252223It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial	1.9830538849938433But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else	3.0687827509243055--Here you are in your own family	2.2704499202922697"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield	2.861802112148413He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire	2.4036113253805187You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one	2.5932365733809206"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen	3.0918199042026555"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man	2.403708639921975Wickham only shook his head	1.1345143336151586"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer	2.9949345466872117"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield	3.253794544792527I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	2.889678271236214no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr	2.3008547108568456If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go	2.0604649562810953We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is	2.9280655624790572Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr	3.753560421513351Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections	2.0880099237734275His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father	3.221409635724355Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	2.5848883861901175Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry	2.7399948731051667"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire	2.7510027012400666I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them	2.931782155675841Society, I own, is necessary to me	1.7026869177952044I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude	2.8363637770199737I _must_ have employment and society	2.103485092510857A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible	2.5075747319862702The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now	3.2362266528273946"Indeed	1.0"Yes--the late Mr	1.0Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift	2.5398431656064897He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me	2.013110114084072I cannot do justice to his kindness	1.6271269513359357"Good heavens	1.0cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be	2.0764531778989728--How could
his will be disregarded	1.569806090266071--Why did not you seek legal redress	1.909734381908745"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law	4.050160264304065A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr	2.967238141274248Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing	2.7995417371936226Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it	3.262213089819536I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely	2.91848061856736I can recal nothing worse	1.3265330208802564But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me	2.727771165160697"This is quite shocking	1.3447557181857652"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_	2.7009200253453325Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_	2.29766493397913Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them	2.3914658175878576"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive	2.6152903882675504--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly	2.2138188690931417"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy	2.3905896602742103Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life	2.654988423686883He had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me	2.70438724043505"I had not thought Mr	2.247460861460731Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this	3.45418800723211His disposition must
be dreadful	1.5804278695904637"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him	3.4985775725747286Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father	2.687648247846614--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner	2.861113677012828"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care	3.0371544638652526_My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr	2.000327739963059Philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late Mr	2.61178851053882Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property	2.3661372075684355Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend	1.7361054039709056Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr	2.5284446387213895Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself	3.0864498455117313"How strange	1.0"How abominable	1.0--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr	2.1833303237538244Darcy has not made him just to you	1.9584687146111592--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it	3.377887066848209"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend	3.04087278648064It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	2.045804569584949But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride	2.8225345895126623"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good	2.0073174733487678"Yes	1.0It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor	2.4060945080748013Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive	2.729742612606886He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers	2.9775846740679057"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy	2.3649177261074295He shook his head	1.0183167458159141--"I wish I could call her amiable	1.999522021370312It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy	2.2862232051478637But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud	2.8688505382965226--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement	2.6396235498332077She is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished	2.68785057248351Since her
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education	2.7726247940623816After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr	2.903165914165128Bingley	1.0How can Mr	1.0Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man	2.5421595675888273How can they suit each other	1.4325100686182046Bingley	1.0"Not at all	1.0"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man	2.2997190652265043He cannot know what Mr	1.4528953398244502Darcy is	1.0"Probably not;--but Mr	1.0Darcy can please where he chuses	1.5963624345781209He does not
want abilities	2.457178157965387He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while	2.48406304172535Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	3.654670825135786His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure	2.5392998296641554Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs	2.010001329419367Philips	1.0--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter	2.4018403317756385It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs	2.878067187192453Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy	3.086678328550954"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	2.9341486871653215There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters	2.7019273142986164Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh	2.573032048384599"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living	2.4888520831826293Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long	2.4572152340470477"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr	2.7321449383152117"No, indeed, I did not	1.4987479051778996--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections	2.5676476699399733I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday	2.549758305355227"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	3.10145474674642Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another	2.8561385014766376Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman	3.021502328036814"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	3.439869155471168She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class	2.7888016551646815Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr	3.0162301147910773Wickham's attentions	1.0There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs	2.1109921613901204Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully	2.246730464825823Elizabeth went away with her head full of him	2.1395426211561634She could
think of nothing but of Mr	1.906699523771349Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr	3.3032123190073155Collins were once silent	1.2276047765859084Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr	2.113272785822886Collins, in describing the civility of Mr	1.6380432630616781Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House	3.077965808481438Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr	2.538051170100493Wickham and herself	1.0Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr	2.43310310495213Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr	2.1491084387201003Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham	2.7231629076853676--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained	2.953879325981833Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other	1.7996416522798115It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side	2.4183533470191807"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business	2.7269176297181335--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody	2.5830010681529263"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion	2.888332300365995My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr	2.3015554889826744--It is
impossible	1.0No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it	2.441216390238542Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him	2.0727963196753696oh	1.0no	1.0"I can much more easily believe Mr	1.8127330416769356Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony	2.4937643656178423--If it
be not so, let Mr	2.1986572288491044Darcy contradict it	1.0"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing	1.818463777482696--One does not know what to
think	1.7576975721196542"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think	2.20480377825376But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr	2.230778226321358Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public	2.740078296384394The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr	3.0623868073181693Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday	2.646423063595682The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation	2.832839165908651To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs	2.2955570093013984They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs	2.402451404687616The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family	2.6084390913887208Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr	2.545881249821315Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card	1.6200834486446292Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr	3.0400258478997273Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr	2.9334789118438875Darcy's
looks and behaviour	1.198478910894253The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr	2.530939930859914And even Mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it	2.6921570340241185"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough	2.361654687254588--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	2.450866692658283Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body	3.0266241074877245Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr	2.8802415121418328Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr	2.6741416798291686Bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance	3.4119395890979076"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her	3.015101570151564She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr	2.504164287491929Collins
instead	1.0There was no help
for it however	2.612783374765926Wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and Mr	2.4508850866697065Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could	2.5231553177338797She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more	2.909798947150887--It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors	2.6072767535483035The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_	2.8455310359253283Elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply	2.6561584124905866Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him	2.3585482766675256If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once	3.379596987407338No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy	2.227068085657325Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr	2.23033646647457Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia	2.4772334396725806CHAPTER XVIII	1.0Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr	2.4058515498838755Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	3.2848123317659983The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her	3.055522352759244She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening	3.035595779925831But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr	2.4937622114220077Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	3.0844021042384506This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make	2.9349809143913204--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham	2.357230655466539She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr	3.056499106104265Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her	1.455009884201163But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice	3.6884176650550704The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification	1.984692090629791Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give	2.298954892535277The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy	2.1023261499042625She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked	3.11986714021279When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr	2.785522390687229Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him	2.642557564601265"I dare say you will find him very agreeable	3.0816525438926203"Heaven forbid	1.0--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all	2.5584806300149294--To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate	2.157839489490715--Do not wish me
such an evil	1.9524104543623348When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	3.2217996864080907Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr	2.6727434671069843Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it	1.9074093873507496They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance	2.800013738736095He replied, and was again silent	1.9621461914656717After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr	2.7871843592980374--_I_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples	2.859121625810177He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said	2.635289961461611"Very well	1.0--That reply will do for the present	1.914272103367157--Perhaps by and bye I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones	2.0656367810553533--But _now_ we may be silent	1.7279756993887756"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing	1.9252455952255216"Sometimes	1.0One must speak a little, you know	1.88822159691036It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible	2.837968869135657"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine	2.704167815341463"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds	2.587050446803405"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say	2.3209542248573083"I must not decide on my own performance	2.0983922931963983She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance	2.5402211245300372The effect was immediate	1.2294389800675247A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on	2.4919061756995418At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"Mr	2.4211506122420654Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain	2.412595784775155"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life	3.238423078781129Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject	1.9464460538677335At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr	2.81162785557864"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir	2.4358203677356207Such very
superior dancing is not often seen	1.9116138263242588It is evident that you belong to the
first circles	2.079788834904129Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place	2.8839410747992784What congratulations will
then flow in	1.5774363701015055I appeal to Mr	1.3905637357744542Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir	2.00910642379029--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	2.799802679729544The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together	2.8057858420487913"I do not think we were speaking at all	3.0697846065285486Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves	2.8177179620494166"What think you of books	1.563939152159451said he, smiling	1.0"Books--Oh	1.0no	1.0--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings	3.139910529350284"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject	3.1179509903486244--We may compare our different opinions	1.7093987847416565"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else	2.70619019468969said he,
with a look of doubt	1.7922481547316085"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr	2.5750789516826837Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable	2.231616534028472You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_	2.5083599945355903"I am," said he, with a firm voice	1.867760817517105"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	2.7588628205548424"I hope not	1.0"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first	2.197744593649452"May I ask to what these questions tend	2.0534845030084856"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity	2.1299771626294883"I am trying to make it out	1.6850703040658732"And what is your success	2.5446719852174287She shook her head	1.0384044206345686"I do not get on at all	3.188112807849222I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	1.8698470788421104"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either	2.7567023425469044"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity	3.1569414052796043"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied	2.259813770724763She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another	2.699538417559453They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham	2.7031109548180665--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
late Mr	2.9998724899649405Darcy's steward	1.0Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr	2.681789810469413Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr	2.6134708115643743Darcy in a most infamous manner	2.3363784031034416I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr	2.9015949684260436Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way	3.101238225214141His coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it	2.515609449101416I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better	2.307760672402833"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr	3.1074418644320283Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself	2.6826519650011718"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer	2.158197033839241--It was kindly meant	1.2113628079598198"Insolent girl	1.0said Elizabeth to herself	1.3814156746605384--"You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	2.5943071273931086I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr	2.2879281425878033She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley	2.873501913443229Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening	2.6318288724860093--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness	3.4220761863979625"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr	2.8782655509509922Wickham	1.0But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon	3.195330211225"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you	3.2038991018602756Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr	2.67434666446344Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr	2.985447767916127Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr	1.7708013783164263Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, Mr	3.6467675202500875Wickham is by no means a respectable young man	2.151786796753283I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr	2.6498688973213245Darcy's
regard	1.0Bingley does not know Mr	2.1751797947806017Wickham himself	1.0"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton	2.271841343587905"This account then is what he has received from Mr	2.358822750206989But what does he say of the living	1.9421803572740068"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr	2.672111980724744Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only	2.909173339093859Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before	3.2358011143981313She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment	2.349607120156693Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it	2.909187420986458Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr	2.40744364948939Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery	3.611720831935531"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness	3.10042411920535I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine	3.0382122514721046Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly	2.549023670675732"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr	2.2286533696606554"Indeed I am	1.0I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_	2.9561011802843633It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night	2.8567326267752673Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr	2.4093470308565808Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr	2.836614871172062Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance	1.9718748951860445Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained	3.3327649013587375You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty	3.046354103492522And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr	2.7024930498958306Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident	2.66653263655141--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man	2.9440769409530527Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr	2.7951470865437686Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility	2.3826464111426886Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr	1.9586342078824117Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way	2.6376456627868747Collins then returned to Elizabeth	1.4368843752698826"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception	2.60935337252606Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	1.9090754130790593He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	3.1752238354312206It was really a very
handsome thought	2.256493631123882Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him	2.3873988121927403As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr	3.1274975723709955Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane	2.869974345125499She saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters	2.8109598210568056When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
soon married to Mr	2.9021106920268234Bingley	1.0--It was an animating subject, and Mrs	1.953722421530394Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match	1.6131499692497326It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs	2.8347383464323634Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	2.2335005957125094She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it	2.4766617314015598In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr	2.7849694850314686Darcy, who sat opposite to them	1.5795791483070059Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	2.097104111704258"What is Mr	1.0Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him	2.517523977614451I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear	3.31117262729821--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr	2.453117518893871--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing	2.4036025288725096Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence	2.91225471537443Her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	2.655944444609208Elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation	1.8357531949008006She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr	2.5980183219509363Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	3.083601607819999The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity	2.320945559748374Elizabeth now began to revive	1.355475849325738But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company	2.6587917176042817By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song	3.0215838184474424Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected	2.6965332198704193--Elizabeth was in agonies	1.36494675330444She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley	2.8292541289442004She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave	2.645188372127851She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night	2.6365110635810334He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child	2.223156460617969You have delighted us long enough	1.5472135044399724Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	2.200032784333119Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good	2.4830976138695218--Others of the party were now applied to	2.3405004283154223"If I," said Mr	1.1860256179211666The
rector of a parish has much to do	2.0184603042850386--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron	3.1010067658711256He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible	2.6425503405808857And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	2.8825102152017674I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family	2.840429968559092And with a bow to Mr	2.4312664313832166Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	2.7566452887928885--Many
stared	1.0--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr	2.1283834860420696Bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr	1.8175017549954007Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man	2.9118425960615597To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed	3.266243472746036Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable	3.068120964463759The rest of the evening brought her little amusement	2.40898162683322She was teazed by
Mr	1.3221125981533142Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others	3.0366939388805023In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	2.622802388250669He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening	3.311999874213535There was no arguing upon such a project	2.598853617106581She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr	2.477124026307739Collins's conversation to herself	1.2269430821714962She was at least free from the offence of Mr	2.373085662148119Darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak	2.4082669716783505She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr	2.9474956230953184Wickham, and rejoiced in
it	1.4406119562689086The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of Mrs	3.2175722025728803Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family	2.681791772894819Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	2.6889950289855293They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs	1.7279344363135245Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr	2.8008647638085433Collins, who was complimenting Mr	1.9001577557978224Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	2.5257989801534815Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene	1.6865921977992009Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other	2.569457583111512Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs	1.8333128472103415Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am	2.6758307234315173When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs	2.215723224882758Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr	2.705849194778047Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation	2.789471822303886Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
months	2.568713528194103Of having another daughter married to Mr	1.7972254610819016Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure	2.2578175943103798Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr	3.544297982042801Bingley and Netherfield	1.0The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn	2.380712627420132Collins made his
declaration in form	1.5510511148265926Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	3.3447260318394973On finding
Mrs	1.0Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs	2.6260441836798645Bennet instantly answered,

"Oh dear	1.3847203407016344--Yes--certainly	1.0--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection	3.3060263263655325--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs	1.6733316945548213And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,

"Dear Ma'am, do not go	2.492388470881038--I beg you will not go	2.4200609781493814Collins must excuse
me	1.1884597767662994--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	3.0173741146311808I am
going away myself	2.1100272020960764"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy	1.2139602821991524--I desire you will stay where you are	1.6290211691044119--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr	2.170428131315244Collins	1.0Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion	2.9211630185378903Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr	2.4156357039413834Collins began	1.0"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections	2.6642295974520183You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address	2.9430063026606645You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	2.5356592203770405Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life	2.6418801583805966But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did	2.842557632909721The idea of Mr	2.1324194636394176Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish	2.7521106210935593Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness	3.319459616588805Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too	2.4143340956870616on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs	2.781290818549535Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr	2.547181380413376Collins, you
must marry	1.6245249459700006A clergyman like you must marry	1.6946262647499561--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way	2.6324940830611974This is my advice	1.382476719196034Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her	2.931925174589821Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer	3.1918276622997124You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite	2.5120514565783783Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women	2.823007893009051But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years	3.0047630668471053This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	2.8832715507875877To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents	2.788529104079648which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to	2.82636861443983On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	2.850296595522351It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	1.7402512551926705"You forget that I have made no
answer	2.1601454917243648Let me do it without farther loss of time	1.9751823774721746Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me	2.0762349996230474I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them	3.152220643381097"I am not now to learn," replied Mr	2.9474879853895537Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time	3.0489758669938705I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	3.124482084874948"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration	2.3017986569982223I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time	2.500652259598735I am perfectly serious in my refusal	2.1471118574435795--You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so	4.346116722524549--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation	2.9341075957546257"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr	2.29950683793597Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you	2.802390781344893And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications	3.0223903931484597"Indeed, Mr	1.0Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary	1.8720134547738116You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say	2.3571866895217086I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	2.7744469306210133In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach	2.799655672248706And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr	2.6710103147332327Collins thus
addressed her,

"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character	3.059302672547738"Really, Mr	1.0Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly	1.8752248555575555If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one	3.1445214390950245"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	2.3243060603854615My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable	2.701808248620896As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females	2.730500302378503"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	3.277499621265708I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	2.3390768931409065My feelings in every respect
forbid it	2.0730568337243573Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart	2.397576939644651"You are uniformly charming	1.1891376202996045cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable	2.737638854066508To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	2.8102435174463114CHAPTER XX	1.0Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs	2.2961271145726454Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	2.6558689799890254Bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so	2.966009100095818"But depend upon it, Mr	1.3326967588124181Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason	1.9711311239245095I will speak to her about it myself directly	2.1338541110734486She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it	3.14444872516789"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr	1.8256236487008124Collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	3.0443537157680542If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity	2.7590063823661226"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs	1.718515790840862Bennet, alarmed	1.0"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these	1.610551607189367In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived	2.695020439365994I will go directly to Mr	1.8897674586880382Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure	2.4436693328160835She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh	3.057863141921714Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar	2.394702077638155You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr	1.876977217412756Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_	3.185883600561398Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication	2.769912964461045"Of what are you talking	1.280565816928716"Of Mr	1.0Collins and Lizzy	1.0Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy	3.0659644914532103--It seems an hopeless business	1.3750470802897088Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him	2.0236479833561027"Let her be called down	1.7034787488418888She shall hear my opinion	1.5456276271680405Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library	2.244539730529843"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared	2.080002020429987"I have sent for
you on an affair of importance	2.007178706726637I understand that Mr	1.3609425058509965Elizabeth replied that it was	1.43410000531652"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused	2.0320594944453676"I have, Sir	1.0"Very well	1.0We now come to the point	1.5074233252199518Is not it so, Mrs	1.9807963523415626"Yes, or I will never see her again	1.9869726713807607"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth	1.6945725442471777From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents	3.4378865763332174--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr	2.0030695744064513Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_	1.7543130764582044Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs	3.275387789040559Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed	2.4057171363712464"What do you mean, Mr	2.063368510541236Bennet, by talking in this way	1.6348600723358968"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request	2.061514352166654I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be	3.5241328342563762Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs	2.5412893456122876Bennet give up the point	1.703970842957631She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns	3.408361420261408She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	2.491848171948459Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did	1.7736267158608756Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed	1.7906133343983885He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way	2.3834528681864833While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them	2.4299750223888004She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here	2.5905119432428796--What do you think has happened this morning	2.286173836097337Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs	2.9079357997091035Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family	3.1849092120207914"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves	2.73959702574556Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth	2.0903160170096795"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs	1.6446427414572415Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way	2.552880746863099--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead	2.9503452948121245--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you	2.6155449790081953--I have done with you from this very day	2.3445365208027162--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word	3.5849510787287753I have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children	2.8611894565672533--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body	2.882204144784429People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking	2.611791373204572Nobody can tell what I
suffer	1.756004264075005--But it is always so	2.7671787704452435Those who do not complain are never
pitied	1.9090398757629676Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	2.3645504616705173She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr	2.6324665829833074Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr	2.920593894105136Collins and me have a little conversation together	2.1499738847971046Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear	2.476535183512802In a doleful voice Mrs	2.0513862814151054Bennet thus began the projected
conversation	1.7947333146970876--"Oh	1.0Collins	1.0Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter	2.352988082512461Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
trust I am resigned	2.929677776728017Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	2.6119272277606975You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr	2.8095608241118577Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	2.5279830584038896My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own	2.2483653978009985But we are all liable to
error	2.057844859526489I have certainly meant well through the whole affair	2.064426561474661My object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise	2.5979652209484065CHAPTER XXI	1.0The discussion of Mr	1.4973190095722178Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	2.6582164330997617As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence	2.4409334308740505He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend	3.590234205941348The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs	2.0321479535804774Collins was also in the same state of angry pride	2.4590087844025246Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it	2.9555366137445622He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay	2.4744683771320704After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr	2.2011321009628215Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball	1.9945925763610048He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over	2.853648976032616Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself	3.1768603482350786She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her	2.815946990466815His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	2.9153401121487335Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately	2.387292210788349The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	2.518082708416194Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs	2.731028112997588When they
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,

"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal	2.7817466378118896You shall hear what she says	1.901989431336995Hurst had a house	1.4022110269147516The next was in these words	1.9319204879019773"I do not pretend to
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence	2.738617046813366I depend on you for that	1.885584178522354To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr	2.999600524752667Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his	2.99668290120432"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country	2.83423969957199But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters	2.6109752042660244Bingley will not be detained in London by
them	2.5189184903392814"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter	2.487373740238806I will read it to you--

"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel	3.122005706682109Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair	3.6051757418455073"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter	2.3407841560116727"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_	2.5728052333578915"Why will you think so	1.6947891913410595It must be his own doing	2.7782606515952692--He is his own master	1.6507892725025852But you do not know _all_	2.5654803504070354I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me	2.009788138305509I will have no reserves from _you_	1.8993879671182816Darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again	2.603623113810485I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister	2.678450636550259I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable	3.3227991487775705My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart	2.9899604634824244With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many	2.9194057175178343"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy	1.9603099584078645--said Jane as she
finished it	2.138692787388465"Is it not clear enough	1.5093452016305589--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly	3.361565724112308to
put me on my guard	1.7362109940247255Can there be any other opinion on the subject	2.0536541336554204"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different	1.806553599803386--Will you hear it	1.2129072391486901"Most willingly	1.0Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy	2.752817034457481She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you	3.139743272914403Jane shook her head	1.0384044206345686--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection	2.0987378513366255Miss Bingley I am sure cannot	3.068435796957182She is
not such a simpleton	2.2531900883032874Could she have seen half as much love in Mr	2.321111182125629Darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes	2.6015408883764706But the case is
this	1.5838563053835149We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way	3.117406846489281But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend	3.0209625112632317"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy	2.468147009072132Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself	2.8679981836480613"That is right	1.0--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine	3.089320188948517Believe her to be deceived by all means	2.2289555802605014You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer	2.3723226211804485"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere	2.8174135161675196"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him	3.2420491400591525"How can you talk so	1.5022085582817062--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate	3.2392541393710483"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion	2.968351441748458"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required	2.4787452412553024A thousand things may arise in six months	1.6921197258812857It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one	3.2517564628353868She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	3.1868871853648666Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	3.023001231294751Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together	3.093098807375713After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr	2.7731265864839045Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses	3.1008065709806947CHAPTER XXII	1.0The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr	2.9029131192324167Collins	1.0Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	1.9108603846059808"It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express	3.0799655087585593Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	2.865781080342957Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself	1.5873854319764955Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon	3.027156163736352But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet	2.901230383238906He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday	2.9308262247353656Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	2.5182423704362735But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	3.135836808228333In as short a time as Mr	1.841857604623358Collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness	3.0374597867545754The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained	2.8626190839351007Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair	2.5465229363642123Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr	2.3669777776035237Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr	2.431807634147091Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St	2.9433488872056706James's	1.0The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion	2.6668120206630417The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid	2.466242083174039Charlotte herself was tolerably composed	1.4522933984515398She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it	2.239705396968074Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary	2.5875815891741976But still he would be her husband	1.979134156008264--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want	2.7021055309675948This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it	2.6461115791183074Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation	2.777310737685896She resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged Mr	2.703754760470716Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	2.6460415793189545A promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	2.9110867210470666As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs	3.3260858640884092"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible	3.5876621841294307They were all astonished; and Mr	2.178277433316204--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness	2.221708200915291"My dear sir," replied Mr	2.031560644415777Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence	2.657765529453862"You cannot be too much on your guard	2.3102392651817074Risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence	3.155903957414953"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire	2.83496424716213As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth	2.819040821728391With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	2.3256045300101778Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	3.311318110403798She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion	2.89369231442447But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away	2.733338707959542Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before	2.6925350039590508The possibility of Mr	2.1131835808856017Collins	1.0my dear Charlotte,--impossible	1.0The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza	2.7698906321317613--Do you think it incredible
that Mr	2.0569998718620752Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	3.1392373367984256But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness	3.1981836573353575"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr	2.7041426127297377Collins was wishing to
marry you	1.5976499522377712But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done	3.708896260759993I am not romantic you know	3.1392479001730194I
never was	1.0I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr	1.9125572589263415Collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state	2.5872773369275404Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family	2.2435973923910133Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	2.6236706601352995It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match	2.9435091789005834The strangeness of Mr	3.0709744548845523Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted	2.4530688335311015She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage	3.3081398119905128Charlotte the wife of Mr	1.081093609456624Collins,
was a most humiliating picture	2.7324563637832706CHAPTER XXIII	1.0With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs	2.80371652585467Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"Good Lord	2.3983105279986323Sir William, how can you tell such a story	2.2958215317665385--Do not you know
that Mr	2.8307766672378087Collins wants to marry Lizzy	1.5381885890766998Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr	2.7764415561279345Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London	2.062452074610891Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent	2.7310671221239984In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr	3.1093946871975993Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	3.2476711480161486Nothing could
console and nothing appease her	1.7283954931163008--Nor did that day wear out her
resentment	1.8876100788081618A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter	2.8641425463367263Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter	3.147090753013917Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	2.70113849705497Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr	2.9622815888219605Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton	2.332818468631612Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs	2.6093382274095136Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away	2.322268251968374Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again	3.0602127289924974Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return	3.007937341115914Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	2.681087775240999After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men	3.0075031082917056Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs	2.4978196783225117On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband	3.050678044785732--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome	2.9665600593767--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable	2.397369689269993Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr	2.4316444411288836Bingley's continued
absence	1.0Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs	2.8195755026778024Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood	2.0932061437403333Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	3.0313576126163992Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring	3.521272912059454The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment	3.0149989609703565But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used	3.0582257680744904It needed all
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity	1.9330228670742517Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction	2.790031770517565He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company	2.7301609531462323Bennet was really in a most pitiable state	2.079513837662198The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her	2.3892217612448126As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence	2.416495304368556Whenever Charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr	2.717397377997244Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr	3.3856966091537912"Indeed, Mr	1.0Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it	3.109567709210416"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	1.7212063077923556Let us hope for
better things	1.68834574967637This was not very consoling to Mrs	2.304806552724821Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	3.0903120020383485If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it	2.9202653133685037"What should not you mind	1.9168663550295622"I should not mind any thing at all	2.2642041867287173"I never can be thankful, Mr	1.8351094611141636"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr	2.173341385712033END OF VOL	1.0I	1.0[Illustration: A VICARAGE HOUSE	1.4112735636743632PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:

Military Library, Whitehall	1.0146997305650096PRIDE & PREJUDICE	1.0CHAPTER I	1.0Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt	1.8722693793037777The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country	2.765815260399857Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort	2.7648570709012223Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it	1.6484783935912732She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr	2.6042854446593457Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture	2.4658348463136215Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation	2.658415189167854That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations	3.2145587930446284Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself	3.0106380196392477It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing	2.901657032040733She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded	2.7512281855859597A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs	2.9701584526994163Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh	2.503556706984757that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	2.5736517219915664It cannot last long	1.2283004661962162He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before	2.95645958664634Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing	2.275056838434124"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason	2.1639406534930634I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with	2.512022257704095Thank God	1.0I have not _that_ pain	2.786953805064087--I shall certainly try to get the better	1.9424694807869387With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself	3.042637063033088"My dear Jane	1.0exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good	2.0611570352851607Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you	2.664964692466371I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve	2.594933124075373Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection	2.191855707643207"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair	2.377538644674502_You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body	2.7649434848527905_I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it	2.1238688985141962There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well	2.598480893633227I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte's marriage	2.8094007660558282It is unaccountable	1.0in every view it
is unaccountable	1.6951915170016973"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these	2.3345724885160744You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper	2.5720521188685432Consider Mr	1.0Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character	1.569336523545591Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin	3.056400122760695My dear Jane, Mr	1.9770811917700297Collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking	2.803236647033988You shall not defend her,
though it is Charlotte Lucas	2.510792511514443You shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness	2.670551506921405"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together	2.831873961360371But enough of this	1.3660338381828505You
mentioned _two_ instances	1.2251171139433723I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk	2.548818105238439We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured	2.6409360987771313We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect	2.927123964494953It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us	2.653530461840547Women fancy admiration means more than
it does	1.8229458895707782"And men take care that they should	1.7525082168719448"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	3.2207962267691523Bingley's conduct to design,"
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery	2.727432163103383Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business	2.4403221709955556"And do you impute it to either of those	2.846489065796781"Yes; to the last	1.3967633731959093But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem	3.0003202918213656"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him	1.8927079982786705"I cannot believe it	1.3629541070083258Why should they try to influence him	1.7854422048988028They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it	2.7474067780557654"Your first position is false	1.697041515286365They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride	2.7204614050167457"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	2.7704367789494855But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's	2.8110068058074495What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable	2.5107118731733435If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	2.8816663192938By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy	2.28116771892342Do not distress me by the idea	1.9117764724932982I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	3.198457076588415Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood	2.985381193255863Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr	2.7715907651804192Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity	2.7021504355749264Bennet's best
comfort was, that Mr	1.6110731618649867Bingley must be down again in the summer	1.8475778852667757Bennet treated the matter differently	1.61383540094614"So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love I find	2.474518730069957I congratulate her	1.0Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	2.2260064930958254When is your turn to come	1.779388586481509You will hardly bear to be
long outdone by Jane	2.3905407984961737Now is your time	1.3903080845086528Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	2.158381898565927Let Wickham
be _your_ man	1.3904793215759206He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably	2.9171708138282364"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	2.206657051116301We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune	2.2616987826556385"True," said Mr	1.0Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it	3.4051916317513897Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family	2.5799303935910696They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve	2.8094937050969238The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr	2.785367048929476Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr	3.1688453490499975Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter	2.377754757435663Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr	3.1108726328483787Darcy was condemned as the worst of men	1.8298477914035434CHAPTER II	1.0After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr	2.162119535861957Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday	2.2832207805967424The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	2.5711273176758125He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks	2.510139370343667On the following Monday, Mrs	1.9673270906919063Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn	2.9617199447869087Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education	2.5858705171790475The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable	3.0174940996518513Gardiner, who was several years younger than
Mrs	2.1448939290530533Bennet and Mrs	1.0Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces	2.5110026894263084Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard	2.315103901677623The first part of Mrs	1.366778312502022Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	2.1750413574661196When this was
done, she had a less active part to play	2.5054691056388365It became her turn to listen	1.6482526749800874Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of	1.876878203499278They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister	2.4376550513511566Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it	2.9176054495349266"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr	3.5016640152267713Bingley, if she could	1.3376350529345442But, Lizzy	1.0Oh, sister	1.0
